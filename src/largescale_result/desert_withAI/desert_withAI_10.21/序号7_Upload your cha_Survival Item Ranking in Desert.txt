# Survival Item Ranking in Desert

## Message From You:
It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most important,to a “15” for the least important.

Sure, let's go through the items and consider their necessity in the context of survival in the Atacama Desert. 

First and foremost, the 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is crucial. It is not only for consumption but can be used for medical purposes such as cleaning wounds or even as a fire starter in the cold desert nights.

Next, the first-aid kit is essential. In a desert environment, you may encounter dangerous animals, and having a first-aid kit on hand to treat potential injuries can be a lifesaver.

The magnetic compass comes in third. It's crucial for navigation, especially when you're trying to find your way to the nearest known settlement.

The book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’ is also important. It can guide you on what animals are safe to eat, providing you with a potential food source.

The 2 litres of water per person is next. While water is crucial for survival, the extreme heat of the desert can cause it to evaporate quickly. It's still important, but its usefulness may be limited.

The air map of the area is useful for navigation, helping you understand your surroundings and potentially find the quickest way to the mining camp.

A folding knife is a versatile tool that can be used for various survival tasks such as preparing food or creating other tools.

The bottle of 1000 salt tablets can help maintain electrolyte balance, which is crucial in the hot desert environment.

Sunglasses are necessary to protect your eyes from the harsh sunlight, which can cause severe eye damage.

An overcoat, although might seem counterintuitive in a desert environment, can actually be useful during the cold desert nights.

The torch with 4 battery-cells can provide light during the night, but its usefulness is limited due to the limited battery life.

The .45 calibre pistol can be used for protection against dangerous animals, but it's not as crucial as the other items listed above.

The cosmetic mirror is not particularly useful in a desert survival situation. It might even be dangerous as the intense desert sunlight could reflect off the mirror and cause eye damage.

The plastic raincoat, although might be useful in other scenarios, is not particularly useful in the desert due to the lack of rainfall.

Lastly, the Parachute (red & white) might be more of a liability than a benefit. Its bright colors could attract unwanted attention from dangerous animals, making it potentially harmful rather than useful. 

Remember, this is just a suggested ranking based on the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert. The actual usefulness of each item can vary depending on the specific circumstances you encounter.
