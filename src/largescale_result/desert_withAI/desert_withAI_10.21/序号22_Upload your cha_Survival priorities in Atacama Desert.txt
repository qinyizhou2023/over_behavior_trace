# Survival priorities in Atacama Desert

## Message From You:
It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most important,to a “15” for the least important.

Given the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert, it's crucial to prioritize items that can aid in immediate survival and signaling for help. 

The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is of paramount importance. It can be used as a disinfectant for cleaning wounds, a fire starter, and to create a highly visible flame for signaling rescue teams. 

A first-aid kit is also essential. In this harsh environment, even minor injuries can become serious if not treated immediately. 

The magnetic compass will be your guide. It's easy to get disoriented in the desert, and this tool can help you maintain a consistent direction towards the mining camp. 

A book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’ will be a key resource for food. It's not just about knowing what you can eat, but also how to catch and prepare it. 

2 litres of water per person is vital. Dehydration can set in quickly in the desert, and having a water supply can buy you precious time. 

An air map of the area could be useful, especially if you're able to identify landmarks or potential water sources. 

The folding knife is a versatile tool. It can be used for everything from preparing food to making other tools or shelters. 

A bottle of 1000 salt tablets can help replace the salt you lose through sweating. However, they should be used sparingly as they can also dehydrate you. 

Sunglasses are important for protecting your eyes from the harsh desert sunlight. Prolonged exposure can lead to vision impairment. 

An overcoat can provide some protection from the sun during the day and keep you warm during the cold desert nights. 

A torch with 4 battery-cells can be useful for navigating and signaling at night. 

The .45 calibre pistol could potentially be used for protection or hunting, but it's not as crucial as the other items. 

A cosmetic mirror offers minimal practical value in a desert survival situation. The intense desert sunlight could reflect off the mirror and cause eye damage. 

A plastic raincoat is unlikely to be of much use in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. 

Finally, the parachute, while brightly colored and potentially useful for signaling, could attract unwanted attention from dangerous animals, making it more of a liability than a benefit.
