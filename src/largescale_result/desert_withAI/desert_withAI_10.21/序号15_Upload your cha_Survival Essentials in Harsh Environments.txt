Absolutely, when venturing into a new environment, especially one as challenging as a desert, it's essential to be well-prepared. One of the first things you should have on hand is a high proof liquor. It might seem unusual, but it's incredibly versatile. It can be used for sterilization, starting fires, and even as a distress signal. 

A first-aid kit is also crucial. In a harsh environment, injuries can happen, and having immediate access to medical supplies can make a significant difference. 

Another important item is a magnetic compass. In a vast, featureless desert, it's easy to lose your way, and a compass can help you maintain your bearings.

Knowledge is power, so having a book about edible desert animals could be a lifesaver. It could help you identify potential food sources in a pinch.

Of course, water is vital. Two litres per person is a good starting point, but remember that in a hot and dry desert, you might need more.

An air map of the area can help you understand the terrain and locate potential water sources or safe zones. 

A folding knife is a versatile tool that can be used for many things, from preparing food to making other tools. 

Salt tablets can help replace the electrolytes lost through sweat, which is particularly important in a hot desert environment.

Sunglasses are important to protect your eyes from the intense desert sun, and an overcoat can provide protection from the cold desert nights.

A torch with battery cells can be useful for navigating during the night, and a loaded pistol can provide a means of defense against potential threats.

A cosmetic mirror, a large plastic raincoat, and a brightly colored parachute might not be as useful. The mirror could potentially cause eye damage due to the intense desert sunlight. The raincoat might not be necessary given the lack of rainfall in most deserts, and the parachute's bright colors could attract unwanted attention from dangerous animals. 

Remember, preparation is key, and having the right items can significantly increase your chances of survival in a desert environment.
