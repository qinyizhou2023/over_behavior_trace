It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most important,to a “15” for the least important.

In a survival situation like this in the Atacama Desert, it's crucial to consider the harsh conditions and prioritize items that will keep us safe, healthy, and able to navigate towards help. 

The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is of utmost importance. It can serve as a disinfectant for cleaning wounds, a fire starter in the cold desert nights, and to create a highly visible flame for signaling rescue teams. 

Next, a first-aid kit is vital for treating any injuries we may sustain, and it can also help manage heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which are common in such extreme temperatures.

A magnetic compass comes next. Despite being off course, it can help us maintain a consistent direction towards the mining camp, which is our best chance of finding help.

The book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’ is also important. It will provide us with valuable knowledge on what local fauna we can hunt or scavenge for sustenance.

2 litres of water per person is essential in such a hot environment. Dehydration can set in quickly, and having a water supply will help keep us hydrated as we make our way towards the mining camp.

An air map of the area can help us understand our surroundings better and plan our route to the mining camp more effectively.

A folding knife is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of survival tasks, such as preparing food, making shelter, or even self-defense.

The bottle of 1000 salt tablets can help replace the salts lost through sweating in the desert heat, preventing dehydration and heat-related illnesses.

Sunglasses are important due to the intense desert sun. They can protect our eyes from damage and help us maintain clear vision.

An overcoat can protect us from the chilly desert nights. Despite the extreme heat during the day, temperatures can plummet after sunset.

A torch with 4 battery-cells can help us navigate during the night and can be used to signal for help.

The .45 calibre pistol, while it could be used for defense, is not as essential as the other items. Its noise could attract unwanted attention, and its usefulness is limited by its ammunition.

A cosmetic mirror is not particularly useful in this situation. It could potentially cause eye damage due to the intense sunlight reflection.

The plastic raincoat is not necessary in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. It's unlikely we'll encounter any rain.

Finally, the parachute, with its bright colors, could potentially attract dangerous animals, making it more of a liability than an asset in this situation.
