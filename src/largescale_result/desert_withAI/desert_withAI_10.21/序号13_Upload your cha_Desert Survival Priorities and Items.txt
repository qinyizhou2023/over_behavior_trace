Sure, let's consider a survival situation in the desert. First and foremost, we must have a 2-litre bottle of 180 proof liquor. It's a multifunctional item that can be used to disinfect wounds, start a fire, and signal for help. 

Next, a first-aid kit is crucial. In the desert, you're likely to encounter various threats like dangerous animals and harsh conditions, so having immediate medical assistance is vital. 

A magnetic compass follows closely. In the vast, featureless landscape of a desert, it's easy to get lost, and a compass can help you maintain a consistent direction.

Then, a book on edible desert animals would be handy. In a survival situation, you might need to resort to hunting local fauna, and this book could be a lifesaver.

Next, we need 2 litres of water per person. While water is essential, it's ranked lower because it can evaporate quickly in the desert heat, and there are ways to obtain it in the desert, like finding an oasis.

An air map of the area is also important to help navigate and locate potential water sources or settlements. 

A folding knife is useful for a variety of tasks, from preparing food to self-defense. 

Salt tablets are necessary to replace the salt lost through sweating in the desert heat. 

Sunglasses are important to protect your eyes from the harsh desert sun.

An overcoat can protect you from the cold desert nights and can also be used for shade during the day.

A torch with 4 battery cells is useful for night time or signaling for help. 

A loaded .45 calibre pistol can be used for hunting or self-defense.

A cosmetic mirror, while it can potentially be used for signaling, is not very practical and could be harmful due to the intense desert sun.

A large plastic raincoat is virtually useless in the dry desert environment.

Lastly, a red and white parachute might attract unwanted attention from dangerous animals, making it more of a liability than a benefit.
