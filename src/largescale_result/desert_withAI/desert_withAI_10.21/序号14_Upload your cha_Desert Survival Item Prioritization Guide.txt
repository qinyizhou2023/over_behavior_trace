# Desert Survival Item Prioritization Guide

## Message From You:
It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most important,to a “15” for the least important.

When it comes to survival in the desert, especially in a harsh environment like the Atacama, certain factors need to be prioritized. 

Firstly, we have to consider the need for prompt medical attention in case of injuries. Therefore, the 2 litres of 180 proof liquor comes first. Its high alcohol content makes it a perfect disinfectant for wounds, and it can also be used as a fire starter to signal for help or to cook food.

Next, a first-aid kit is essential, as it contains necessary medical supplies that can help treat injuries or ailments that may occur during our survival journey. 

A magnetic compass is our third priority. It's crucial to know our direction in such a vast and monotonous landscape where it's easy to get lost.

Fourthly, the book 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten' would be a great help. It would guide us on what local fauna can be consumed, providing us with necessary nutrients.

Our fifth priority would be 2 litres of water per person. While water is essential, we rank it fifth because there are ways to find water in the desert, like looking for an oasis.

An air map of the area would be our sixth priority. While it's important to know the area, we've already got a compass to guide us.

A folding knife comes seventh. It's a versatile tool that can be used for various purposes, such as preparing food or making other survival tools.

Next, we have a bottle of 1000 salt tablets. They can help replace the salts lost through sweating in the desert heat.

Sunglasses come ninth. They're crucial to protect our eyes from the intense desert sun and prevent potential vision damage.

Overcoats are our tenth priority. While they may seem unnecessary in the desert heat, they can protect us from the cold desert nights and potential sunburn during the day.

Eleventh, we have a torch with 4 battery-cells. It can be useful during the night, but its use is limited due to the scarcity of darkness in the desert.

A .45 caliber pistol is our twelfth priority. While it could potentially be used for hunting or protection, its loud noise could attract unwanted attention.

The cosmetic mirror comes thirteenth. Its practical use in a desert survival situation is minimal and could even be dangerous due to the risk of eye damage from reflected sunlight.

A plastic raincoat is our fourteenth priority. Rain is rare in the Atacama Desert, making this item almost useless.

Lastly, we have a parachute. Its bright colors might attract dangerous animals, making it more of a liability than a benefit.
