# Survival Priorities in Atacama Desert

## Message From You:
It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most  important,to a “15” for the least important.

Notice:
	what you need to know before you can begin creating a list of essential items? The list of items is dependent upon the location and conditions of the new world.

Your items:
	Torch with 4 battery-cells
	Folding knife
	Air map of the area
	Plastic raincoat (large size)
	Magnetic compass
	First-aid kit
	.45 calibre pistol (loaded) (.45口径手枪)
	Parachute (red & white) (降落伞)
	Bottle of 1000 salt tablets
	2 litres of water per person
	A book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’
	Sunglasses (for everyone)
	2 litres of 180 proof liquor (2升90度的烈酒)
	Overcoat (for everyone)
	A cosmetic mirror

Given the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert, we need to prioritize items that can help us navigate, stay healthy, and signal for help. Here's my take on the importance of these items:

1. The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is paramount. It can serve as a disinfectant for cleaning wounds, as a fire starter, and to create a highly visible flame for signaling rescue teams. 

2. The first-aid kit comes next. In the desert, we should be prepared for potential injuries from the harsh environment or encounters with wildlife.

3. The magnetic compass is crucial for navigation. It will help us head in the right direction towards the mining camp.

4. The book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’ would be of great help. It will guide us on what local fauna we can rely on for sustenance.

5. 2 litres of water per person is essential to prevent dehydration, but it's ranked lower as we can potentially find water sources in the desert.

6. The air map of the area could help us understand our surroundings and plan a route towards the mining camp.

7. The folding knife is useful for many things, from preparing food to self-defense.

8. The bottle of 1000 salt tablets can help replace electrolytes lost through sweating.

9. Sunglasses are important to protect our eyes from the intense desert sun.

10. Overcoats, although not ideal for the heat, could provide protection from the cold desert nights.

11. The torch with 4 battery-cells could be used for signaling or for visibility during the night.

12. The .45 calibre pistol could be used for self-defense, but it's not as crucial as other items.

13. The cosmetic mirror is of little use. Its reflection could potentially cause eye damage due to the intense desert sun.

14. The plastic raincoat is practically useless in the desert environment, where rainfall is rare.

15. The parachute, although brightly colored, might attract unwanted attention from dangerous wildlife, making it more of a liability than a benefit.

Remember, survival is about making the best use of what you have at hand. The ranking of these items is based on their potential utility in the desert environment.
