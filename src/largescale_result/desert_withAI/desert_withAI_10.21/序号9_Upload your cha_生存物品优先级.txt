# 生存物品优先级

It is approximately 10:00 am in mid-July and you have just crash landed in the Atacama Desert in South America. Your light twin-engined plane containing the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burned out with only the frame remaining. None of you have been injured. The pilot was unable to notify anyone of your position before the crash. However, he had indicated before impact that you were 50 miles (about 80 km) from a mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, and approximately 65 miles (about 104 km) off the course that was filed in your Flight Plan. The immediate area is quite flat, except for occasional cacti, and appears to be rather barren. The last weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110 F (43℃) today, which means that the temperature at ground level will be 130 F (54℃). You are dressed in lightweight clothing-short-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and street shoes. Everyone has a handkerchief and collectively, you have 3 packs of cigarettes and a ballpoint pen. Before your plane caught fire, your group was able to salvage the 15 items listed on the “Salvaged Items” page. Your task is to rank these items according to their importance to your survival, starting with a “1” for the most important,to a “15” for the least important.

Notice:
	what you need to know before you can begin creating a list of essential items? The list of items is dependent upon the location and conditions of the new world.

Your items:
	Torch with 4 battery-cells
	Folding knife
	Air map of the area
	Plastic raincoat (large size)
	Magnetic compass
	First-aid kit
	.45 calibre pistol (loaded) (.45口径手枪)
	Parachute (red & white) (降落伞)
	Bottle of 1000 salt tablets
	2 litres of water per person
	A book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’
	Sunglasses (for everyone)
	2 litres of 180 proof liquor (2升90度的烈酒)
	Overcoat (for everyone)
	A cosmetic mirror


## ChatGPT:
Given the conditions you've described, it's crucial to prioritize items that can assist in navigation, provide protection from the harsh sun, and aid in potential medical emergencies. 

Firstly, the 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is incredibly versatile. It can be used for medical purposes, such as sterilizing wounds, and also as a fire starter. 

A first-aid kit is undoubtedly essential. In such a barren landscape, injuries can occur easily, and immediate medical treatment can be lifesaving.

A magnetic compass would be our third priority. Although the area is flat, a compass can provide a sense of direction and help us head towards the mining camp.

Next, the book titled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten' would be a valuable resource. It could guide us on what local fauna can be safely consumed, supplementing our food supply.

The 2 litres of water per person would be ranked next. While water is crucial for survival, it's ranked lower due to the potential evaporation in the extreme desert heat.

An air map of the area would be useful for navigation, helping us understand the terrain and locate potential sources of water or shelter.

A folding knife can be used for a variety of tasks, including preparing food, making tools, or even as a means of defense.

The bottle of 1000 salt tablets could help replenish lost electrolytes due to excessive sweating in the desert heat.

Sunglasses are crucial in the desert to protect our eyes from the sun's harsh glare and prevent potential vision damage.

An overcoat, while seemingly counterintuitive in a hot desert, can actually provide protection from the sun and help prevent dehydration.

A torch with 4 battery-cells can be useful for navigating in the dark and potentially signaling for help.

The .45 calibre pistol could serve as a means of defense against potential threats, but due to the barren landscape, it's ranked lower.

A cosmetic mirror might not seem very useful in a survival situation, and in fact, it could be potentially harmful, reflecting intense sunlight and causing eye damage.

A plastic raincoat is not very useful in a desert environment, where rainfall is rare.

Lastly, the parachute, while it could potentially be used as a makeshift shelter, its bright colors could attract unwanted attention from dangerous animals, making it more of a liability than an asset. 

Remember, survival is all about prioritizing resources and using them wisely.

给出你认为这么排名合理的理由


## ChatGPT:
Absolutely, here are the reasons for the ranking:

1. 2 litres of 180 proof liquor - This is at the top of the list due to its versatility. It can be used for medical purposes such as sterilizing wounds, and it can also be used to start a fire for warmth or for signaling for help.

2. First-aid kit - This is critical for treating any injuries that may occur. In a harsh environment like the desert, immediate medical treatment can be lifesaving.

3. Magnetic compass - In the vast and flat desert, a compass can provide a sense of direction, helping you head towards the mining camp.

4. A book entitled ‘Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten’ - This could be a valuable resource for identifying local fauna that can be safely consumed, supplementing your food supply.

5. 2 litres of water per person - While water is essential for survival, it's ranked lower due to the potential for it to evaporate quickly in the extreme desert heat.

6. Air map of the area - This would be useful for understanding the terrain and locating potential sources of water or shelter.

7. Folding knife - This can be used for a variety of tasks, such as preparing food, making tools, or even as a means of defense.

why air map is so important



## ChatGPT:
An air map of the area is indeed important, and it's ranked 6th on the list. The desert is a vast and often monotonous landscape, making it easy to get lost or disoriented. An air map can provide a broader perspective of the terrain, helping you understand your surroundings and identify key landmarks.

Moreover, it can guide you towards potential sources of water, settlements, or even help you avoid dangerous areas. In a survival situation, navigation is key, and an air map can significantly aid in this regard. Even though it's not as essential as immediate medical supplies or fire-starting equipment, it's still quite important for long-term survival.
