    "answer": "There are multiple reasons for loud sneezes. Sneezing is an essential body function that serves to protect our lungs. It helps flush out particulates from our nasal cavity, a process facilitated by a small compound and encoded by a sneeze gene. Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the structure of our respiratory system, including deep inhalation, vocal cord closure, and the expulsion of air, determines the volume of a sneeze.\n\nThe sound of a sneeze is influenced by the shape and floppiness of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume. Furthermore, cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. Takashma notes that in Japan, people often suppress their sneezes to avoid inconveniencing others, achieved by keeping the mouth closed. This lines up with other Japanese societal norms that center around convenience being in the form of inconveniencing others less.\n\nHowever, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nosebleeds or sinus damage. Despite this, if one needs to sneeze quietly, keeping the mouth closed can help. Overall, sneezing is a complex reflex influenced by biological, anatomical, and cultural factors, and it plays a vital role in our immune system's protection against viruses."
