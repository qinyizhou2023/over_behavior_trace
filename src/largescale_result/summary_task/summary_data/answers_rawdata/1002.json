The action is triggered by a sneeze gene and small compounds in the nasal cavity, causing reflexive muscle contractions. Then, it mentions that the volume is not affected by the external environment.

The process begins with deep inhalation, followed by the closure of vocal cords during which pressure builds up in the lungs. The sound of the sneeze is created by the air gushing through the vocal cords. The shape and flexibility of our vocal cords and throat tissue, along with lung volume, affect the sneeze's volume. However, sneeze volume isn't predictable by a single physical measure, as even individuals with large lung volumes can have quiet sneezes.
