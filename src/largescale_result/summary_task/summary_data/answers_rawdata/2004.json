    "answer": "Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism. It helps to flush out old cells and particulates trapped in our nasal cavity, thus safeguarding our lungs. This process is triggered by a small compound in our nasal cavity that activates when it detects high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. The sneeze signal is then processed by the hippocampus in the brain, causing reflexive muscle contractions. These contractions not only determine the speed of the sneeze but also play a role in our immune system by helping to protect us from viruses.\n\nDr. Mas Takashma, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system and the amount of air expelled through the vocal cords. The shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat also have a role in determining the sound of a sneeze. However, Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchesterâ€™s Division of Immunology asserts that while the causes of sneezing vary, a virus does not necessarily produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen.\n\nDespite the various factors influencing the loudness of a sneeze, it is important to remember that holding back a sneeze can cause damage to the nose and sinus. Dr. Takashma suggests that keeping your mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly. This can reduce the volume of the sneeze without causing potential harm. Moreover, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze."
