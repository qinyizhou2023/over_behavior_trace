    "answer": "Sneezing, a reflexive bodily function, plays a critical role in our health by acting as a protective mechanism. It helps to expel old cells and potentially harmful particles from our body, thereby aiding the immune system in protecting us from viruses. The signal for sneezing, whether triggered by a grass pollen or a virus, comes from the brain, but it's never evident that each of these causes different loudness for sneezing. The structure of the respiratory system is largely responsible for the loudness of a sneeze. The first step of sneezing is inhalation. Once air is inhaled, the vocal cords close, and when a person has to expel that air, it passes through the vocal cords, causing the characteristic sneezing sound. Along with the vocal cords and the respiratory system, cultural factors also play an important role in determining the loudness of a sneeze. Suppression of sneezing may cause medical issues.\n\nThe nose, acting as a natural filter, traps these particles and when overwhelmed, triggers a sneeze through a small compound in our nasal cavity. This sneeze response is controlled by a specific \"sneeze gene\". Once an irritant is detected, a sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and volume of the sneeze.\n\nThe volume of a sneeze is influenced by not only these biological factors, but also by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. Renowned scientist Takashma and expert Sheena Cruikshank caution that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. They recommend that the most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. However, it's essential to remember that sneezing is a natural, healthy response and should not be suppressed unnecessarily."
