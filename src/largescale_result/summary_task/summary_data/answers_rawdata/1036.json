    "answer": "The article explores why some sneezes are louder than others. Sneezing, a crucial physiological function, helps our nose, the lungs' air filter, trap and flush out particulates. A small compound in the nasal cavity triggers this mechanism, with immune cells activating upon detecting sneeze-inducing compounds. The subsequent immune response leads to increased mucus production and swelling, with the sneeze signal processed by the brain's hippocampus, prompting reflexive muscle contractions that defend against viruses.\n\nSneeze volume is influenced by our respiratory system's structure, including vocal cord shape and flexibility, and lung volume. Cultural norms and psychological factors also affect sneeze sound. In societies like Japan, where inconveniencing others is frowned upon, sneezes are often suppressed. However, this can cause medical issues, including sinus fractures and nosebleeds, due to the pressure of a suppressed sneeze damaging the nose and sinuses.\n\nIn conclusion, while keeping the mouth closed can quieten a sneeze, complete suppression should be avoided due to potential health risks."
