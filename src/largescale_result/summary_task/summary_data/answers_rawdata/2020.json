    "answer": "The volume of a sneeze can be influenced by multiple factors. Firstly, it's important to understand that sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and potentially harmful particles from our nasal cavity. This process is initiated by a sneeze gene and is facilitated by a small compound in our nasal cavity.\n\nThe sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, which in turn triggers reflexive muscle contractions. These contractions determine the speed and, therefore, the volume of the sneeze. Some people may have stronger contractions, leading to louder sneezes.\n\nAnother factor that can influence the volume of a sneeze is how we control it. For instance, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, causing a louder sound. On the other hand, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.\n\nSneezing also helps the immune system in protecting us from viruses, hence it's a crucial bodily function. However, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For example, some people might sneeze loudly due to cultural habits or societal expectations.\n\nAccording to Sheena Cruikshank, an immunology expert, the way we sneeze is largely individual and can be influenced by these numerous factors. So, while some people might sneeze loudly, others might have a quieter sneeze."
