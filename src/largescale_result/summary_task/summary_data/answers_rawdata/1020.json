    "answer": "Sneezing is not merely a reflex, but a complex protective mechanism. Triggered by a specific gene and a tiny compound in our nasal cavity, the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. It aids in expelling old cells, bolstering our immune system's defense against viruses.\n\nThe sound and volume of a sneeze are influenced by reflexive muscle contractions, which also determine the speed of a sneeze. Cultural norms, psychological factors, and societal norms further shape the character of a sneeze.\n\nProminent otolaryngologist, Mas Takashma, along with immunology professor, Sheena Cruikshank, emphasize the potential harm of suppressing a sneeze, which can damage the nose and sinus surface. To sneeze quietly, they recommend keeping the mouth closed.\n\nIn summary, sneezing is a crucial protective function, steered by a unique gene and a nasal compound. It supports our immune system and varies among individuals due to factors like muscle contractions and societal norms. It's more than a reflex; it's a vital part of our body's defense system."
