    "answer": "Sneezing is a vital bodily function, triggered by a specific gene and facilitated by a small compound in our nasal cavity. It plays a crucial role in protecting our lungs by trapping particles in the nasal cavity, which is made up of a mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus. This process is processed by the hippocampus in the brain.\n\nMas Takashma, the head of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, likens the nose to an air filter. Our nasal immune cells are on constant alert for high concentrations of sneeze-inducing compounds. When detected, these cells initiate changes in the nose lining, leading to increased mucus production and swelling, a common response during a pollen-filled summer or a phlegmy winter.\n\nSheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchesterâ€™s Division of Immunology, explains that the sneeze signal is sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions. These contractions, in turn, determine the speed of the sneeze. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism, helping to flush out old cells and bolstering the immune system in its fight against viruses.\n\nThe volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung volume. However, it is not determined by the cause of the sneeze. The sound of a sneeze can also be affected by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms.\n\nTakashma points out that in cultures where there is an emphasis on not disturbing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes. However, holding back a sneeze can be harmful, potentially damaging the surface of the nose and sinus. He suggests that the most effective way to reduce the volume of a sneeze without causing harm is to keep the mouth closed."
