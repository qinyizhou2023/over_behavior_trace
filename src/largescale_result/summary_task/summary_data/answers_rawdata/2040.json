    "answer": "This article talks about how loud people sneeze and the importance of sneezing. Sneezing is an important function of our body that helps clear out our nasal cavity and helps our immune system by protecting and keeping out viruses from entering our body. The sounds and volume of our sneeze is influenced by a our respiratory system. Something i found interesting is that it can also be influenced by cultural norms. Like in Japan, in their culture, they value respecting others and to not inconvenience other, they are accustomed to sneeze as quietly as possible. The key to keeping quiet though, is simply to close your mouth, if you hold back a sneeze it can cause some medical issues like a nose bleed. All in all, the loudness of a sneeze ismt determined by the type of irritant like a virus or pollen, but rather by multiple factors ranging from cultural norms to the size of your lungs. People with larger lungs expell air at a constant and reasonable rate, so they often have petite sneezes. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus and muscle contractions determine the speed. "
