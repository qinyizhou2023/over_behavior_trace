    "answer": "1. Sneezing is a reflexive response initiated when our noses detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, serving as a vital protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and enhance the immune system's protection against viruses.\n\n2. The speed and volume of a sneeze are determined by vocal chord floppiness and lung volume, influenced by cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors. For instance, in Japan, societal norms encourage people to sneeze quietly by keeping their mouths closed.\n\n3. Suppressing a sneeze by holding it back may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. However, if a quieter sneeze is necessary, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective method."
