    "answer": "Sneezing is a vital protective mechanism of the body that helps flush out old cells and particulates from the nasal cavity, thereby protecting the lungs. This process is triggered by a sneeze gene and the presence of certain compounds in our nose. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, which results in reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of the sneeze.\n\nProfessor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchester's Division of Immunology explains that changes in the lining of our nose, due to immune response, cause increased mucus production and swelling, leading to a sneeze. However, the volume of a sneeze is not determined by the cause but by the structure of our respiratory system, including our lung volume and the characteristics of our vocal cords.\n\nDr. Mas Takashima from Houston Methodist Academic Institute adds that cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in cultures emphasizing not causing inconvenience to others, people tend to suppress their sneezes, often by keeping their mouths closed. However, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, and potentially cause other medical issues. Therefore, while sneezing quietly may be desirable in certain situations, it's essential to do so without causing harm to oneself."
