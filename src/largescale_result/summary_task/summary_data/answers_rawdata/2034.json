    "answer": "The volume of a sneeze is determined by several factors. Primarily, it's the reflexive muscle contractions that dictate the speed and force of the sneeze, thereby affecting its volume. When the 'sneeze gene' is activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity, the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. This triggers a series of rapid contractions in our diaphragm and other muscles, leading to a forceful expulsion of air.\n\nHowever, the loudness of a sneeze isn't solely determined by biological factors. Cultural factors, psychological influences, and societal norms can also play a significant role. For instance, some people may sneeze loudly as a form of personal expression or due to cultural habits. Conversely, others may suppress their sneezes to conform to societal expectations of politeness and discretion.\n\nIt's important to note that suppressing a sneeze can potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinus. If one wishes to sneeze more quietly, keeping the mouth closed is often the most effective method. However, it's crucial to remember that sneezing is a natural and necessary bodily function, serving as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting from viruses."
