    "answer": "1. Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that acts as a protective mechanism. It is initiated by a sneeze gene and a small compound in our nasal cavity. According to Mas Takashima, the particulates can be trapped in the nose, and then can be flushed out by sneezing. Additionally, immune cells in the nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds,  the sneeze signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata. This results in reflexive muscle contractions, leading to a sneeze. \n2. The key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. During a sneeze, air is deeply inhaled into our lungs while our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up, the air is expelled, and the sound of the sneeze is created by the air rushing through the vocal cords.However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze.\n\n3. Suppressing a sneeze can be harmful. It may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study from a hospital in Li√®ge, Belgium, reported a man fracturing his sinus after holding back a sneeze. However, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze, especially in situations where silence is required. Keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can effectively reduce the volume, as suggested by Takashima."
