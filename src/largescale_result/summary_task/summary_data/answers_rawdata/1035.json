    "answer": "The article revolves around the science behind sneezing, its importance to the body, and the factors that influence its volume. It explains that sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps to flush out particulates trapped in the nasal cavity, hence safeguarding the lungs. Sneeze is often triggered by a mesh of epithelial cells,  tiny hairs, and mucus in our nose. When the particles build up, sneeze is triggered. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain. The hippocampus transmits nerve impulses to the reflexive muscle contractions which leads to sneeze. For instance, when we smell pepper, the hippocampus in our brain processes the signal and triggers a sneeze. Sneezing also aids in the immune system in protecting from viruses and flushes out old cells. Moreover, its volume is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system and societal factors. Suppressing a sneeze can lead to health issues. A case study reported a man fracturing his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. Keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly."
