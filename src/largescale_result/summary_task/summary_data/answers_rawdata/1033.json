    "answer": "Sneezing, triggered by a \"sneeze gene\" and a compound in our nasal cavity, helps protect the body by flushing out old cells and aiding the immune system against viruses. The loudness of a sneeze is determined by reflexive muscle contractions and can be influenced by cultural, psychological, and societal factors. Keeping the mouth closed can make the sneeze quieter. People may want to sneeze quietly due to societal norms and cultural factors, to reduce sneeze volume, keep your mouth closed when sneezing, but avoid suppressing it completely to prevent nasal and sinus damage. Next time if you want to sneeze quietly but not offend your health, you can try to sneeze into a tissue or your elbow to muffle the sound."
