    "answer": "1. Sneezing is a vital function of the body, acting as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity. This is triggered by a small compound in our nasal cavity and signals processed by the hippocampus in our brain. The process involves immune cells in our nose, which respond to high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, resulting in changes in the lining of our nose. Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchesterâ€™s Division of Immunology explains that this leads to more mucus production, swelling in the nose, and reflexive muscle contractions that result in a sneeze.\n\n2. The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and floppiness of our vocal cords and the volume of our lungs. According to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, the pressure built up in our lungs and the gush of air that pushes through the vocal cords create the sound of the sneeze.\n\n3. Suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues, as it may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. An example is given of a man who fractured his sinus after holding back a sneeze during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, especially in situations where one does not want to cause a disturbance."
