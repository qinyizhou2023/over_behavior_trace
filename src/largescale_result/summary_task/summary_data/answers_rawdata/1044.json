    "answer": "1.Physiological Factors: The volume of a sneeze is influenced by our respiratory system's structure, including vocal cords and lung volume. A small compound in our nasal cavity triggers a sneeze signal processed by the hippocampus. Reflexive muscle contractions then determine the sneeze's speed and volume.\n\n2.Societal Influences: Cultural norms can also impact the volume of a sneeze. For example, in Japan, societal norms often lead to suppressed sneezes, as highlighted by Dr. Mas Takashma from the Houston Methodist Academic Institute.\n\n3.Risks and Solutions: Suppressing a sneeze can damage the nose and sinus. To sneeze quietly, Dr. Takashma suggests keeping the mouth closed, reducing the resonant energy and the sneeze's volume."
