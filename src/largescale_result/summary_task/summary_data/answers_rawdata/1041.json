    "answer": "1.The loudness of a sneeze is largely determined by the structure and function of our respiratory system. The process of sneezing involves deep inhalation followed by the closure of our vocal cords. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, the air is expelled, creating the sound of the sneeze. The shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat can influence the volume of our sneeze. Additionally, the volume of air that enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, determined by our lung volume, can contribute to the loudness of a sneeze.\n\n2.Cultural and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. In societies where there is a strong emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes. The key to suppressing the volume of a sneeze lies in minimizing the amount of resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, which can be achieved by closing the mouth. However, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nose bleeds or problems with the eardrum.\n\n3.Lastly, sneezing is a reflexive response triggered by various factors, including the presence of foreign particles in the nasal cavity. This response is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, causing reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. The force of these contractions and the subsequent release of air through the vocal cords can contribute to the volume of the sneeze. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and supports the immune system in protecting from viruses. Therefore, the loudness of a sneeze may also be a reflection of the body's effort to protect itself."
