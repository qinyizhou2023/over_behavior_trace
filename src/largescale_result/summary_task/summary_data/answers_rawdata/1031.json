    "answer": "Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism. The sneeze gene triggers a response in our body when there's a buildup of particulates in our nasal cavity, a small compound helps in this process. This response includes the production of more mucus, swelling in the nose, and signals sent to the brain. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. This process helps to flush out old cells and protects the immune system from viruses.\n\nThe volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords and other soft tissues at the back of the throat. The volume of air entering and leaving our chest during a sneeze also plays a role. However, other factors such as cultural norms, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, people manage to suppress their sneezes due to a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others.\n\nWhile it may seem beneficial to suppress a sneeze to reduce its volume, doing so can potentially cause damage to the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study revealed a man who held back a sneeze ended up with a fractured sinus. Dr. Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, suggests that keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, reducing the risk of causing medical issues such as nose bleeds or problems with the eardrum."
