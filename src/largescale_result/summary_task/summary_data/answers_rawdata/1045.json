    "answer": "The article initially underscores sneezing as an integral bodily function, serving two primary purposes. It facilitates the expulsion of old cells and particulates from the nasal cavity, a process initiated by a specific compound found therein. Furthermore, sneezing aids in safeguarding our immune system against viral infections.\n\nThe mechanics of sneezing are then elucidated. The brain's hippocampus processes the sneeze signal, while the nose, functioning as an air filter for the lungs, traps particulates. The immune cells in the nose spring into action upon detecting high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, causing alterations in the nasal lining.\n\nThe article proceeds to explore the origins of the sneeze sound. The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and reflexive muscle contractions. The sneezing process involves deep inhalation, closure of vocal cords, and a build-up of pressure in the lungs. The sound of a sneeze is produced when air is forcefully expelled through the vocal cords. The volume of a sneeze can be influenced by factors such as the shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords and other soft tissues at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume.\n\nLastly, the article delves into how societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can influence the sound of a sneeze. In cultures where there is an emphasis on not inconveniencing others, individuals often suppress their sneezes by keeping their mouths closed. However, this could potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinuses. In circumstances where a loud sneeze may be deemed inappropriate, keeping the mouth closed can effectively reduce the volume of the sneeze."
