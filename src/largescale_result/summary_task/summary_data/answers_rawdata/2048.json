    "answer": "1) Sneezing is a critical bodily function that helps protect humans' lungs from harmful particles and supports the immune system. Inside our noses are cells that protect our lungs by trapping particles that might damage them. However, as these particulates build up, they eventually need to be expelled. Thus, the urge to sneeze is triggered and processed by our brains, leading to a muscle contraction we call a sneeze. There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which become active when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds.\n2) The volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung capacity. The gust of air needed to expel the particulates rushing through the vocal cords is what creates the actual sound people make when they sneeze. The first step of any sneeze is a deep inhale, which could look different from person to person. Then, the structure of the vocal cords also varies between people and influences the sound of a sneeze. On the other hand, cultural norms, societal factors, and psychological influences can also shape the sound of a sneeze. In some cultures, such as Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes to avoid disturbing others.\n3) Suppressing a sneeze can be harmful to the person sneezing. While for the most part, people who keep their mouths shut during a sneeze will be fine, there are case studies, such as one in Belgium during the peak of the coronavirus, where a man who suppressed his sneeze ended up fracturing his sinus. Nosebleeds and eardrum issues are also potential negative effects of suppressing a sneeze."
