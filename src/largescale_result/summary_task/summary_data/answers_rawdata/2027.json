    "answer": "The article discusses the biological and societal factors influencing the volume of a sneeze. Sneezing, as explained by Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, is a crucial body function that serves as an air filter for the lungs. Inside our nose, a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus traps particulates to protect the lungs. When these particulates build up, they need to be flushed out, which is done by sneezing. The sneeze reflex is triggered by a small compound in our nasal cavity, and the sneeze signal is processed by the medulla oblongata in our brain.\n\nSneezing also plays a role in our immune system. There are immune cells in our nose that wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. According to Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchesterâ€™s Division of Immunology, the chemicals produced as a consequence of the immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose, leading to more mucus production, swelling, and the sneeze reflex.\n\nThe volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and the amount of air we inhale and expel during a sneeze. However, societal norms and cultural factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. Takashima points out that in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes due to cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others. However, suppressing a sneeze might cause medical issues such as nose bleeds or issues with the eardrum. The most effective way to sneeze quietly is to keep the mouth closed."
