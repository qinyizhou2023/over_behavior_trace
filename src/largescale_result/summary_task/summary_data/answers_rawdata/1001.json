    "answer": "Physiological Mechanism of Sneezing\nSneezing, a critical bodily function, is primarily influenced by the structure of our respiratory system. The sneeze gene, activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity, initiates the sneezing process. The signal is then processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of a sneeze. The sound of the sneeze is produced when air, built up in our lungs through deep inhalation, is expelled through our vocal cords and soft tissue in the throat. This process serves as a protective mechanism, helping to flush out old cells and particulates, consequently safeguarding our lungs and aiding the immune system in virus protection.\n\nPotential Risks of Suppressing a Sneeze\nHowever, suppressing a sneeze can pose health risks, potentially damaging the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study highlighted a man who fractured his sinus after holding back a sneeze, underscoring the potential dangers of sneeze suppression.\n\nCultural Influences and Societal Norms\nThe volume of a sneeze isn't solely determined by physiological factors; societal norms and cultural influences also play a significant role. For instance, in societies like Japan, where not inconveniencing others is highly valued, people tend to suppress their sneezes. Despite the potential risks, there are safer ways to minimize the volume of a sneeze. Dr. Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can effectively reduce its sound. Thus, the loudness of sneezes is a complex phenomenon, shaped by both biological and societal factors."
