    "answer": "This article discusses the science behind sneezing, highlighting its importance for the body. Mas Takashima, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the nose acts as an air filter for the lungs. It traps particulates to protect the lungs, and when these particulates build up, they need to be expelled, resulting in a sneeze.\n\nThe process of sneezing involves immune cells in the nose that detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. Changes occur in the lining of our nose due to the immune response, leading to more mucus and swelling. The brain receives signals via the trigeminal nerve, which are processed by the medulla oblongata, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions and a sneeze.\n\nThe volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, not the cause of the sneeze. Deep inhalation is the first step of the sneeze reflex, followed by the closing of vocal cords. The sound of the sneeze is created by the rush of air pushing through the vocal cords.\n\nTakashima also notes that societal norms or cultural factors can influence the sound of a sneeze. For example, in Japan, where there is a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes. However, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nose bleeds and eardrum problems. Keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can help to reduce the volume."
