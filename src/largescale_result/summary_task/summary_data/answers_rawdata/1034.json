    "answer": "1.Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps to flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity, thereby aiding our immune system in protecting us from viruses. The process is initiated by a small compound in our nasal cavity and the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions.\n\n2.The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords and lung volume. However, it's also influenced by cultural norms, societal expectations, and psychological factors. For instance, in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes to avoid inconveniencing others.\n\n3.Suppressing a sneeze can lead to health issues such as nose bleeds and potential damage to the eardrum. Despite this, there are situations where a quieter sneeze may be preferred, and keeping the mouth closed can help to achieve this. However, it's important to balance the need for quietness with potential health risks."
