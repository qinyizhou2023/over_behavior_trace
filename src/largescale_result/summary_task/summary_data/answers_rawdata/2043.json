    "answer": "Mas Takashima tries establishing the reasons and causes behind sneezes and why they sound different and the narrator tries to answer the question of \"Why is MY sneeze so loud\". He begins this talk by talking about the triggers behind one's sneezing. After talking about the triggers, he also mentions that just because one feels triggered to sneeze doesn't mean that their sneeze would be loud. He goes on to say that although different people experience the trigger to sneeze, it's ultimately the shape and structure of their vocal cords and mouth that determines the loudness and the intensity of sneezing. He then goes on to talk about another layer which ends up influencing the final result which in this case being how loud is one's sneeze heard. He talks that in certain cultures such as a Japan where the need to not disturb others is emphasized, people are conditioned to contain in their sneeze volume, which Takashima condemns due to the adverse effects that suppressing one's sneeze has on their body. He cites a couple of examples of side effects that occurred when patients tried suppressing their sneeze. Despite this he also goes onto to give a technique to reduce the output volume of one's sneeze should they find themselves in an unfavorable environment where their loud sneezing could harm them."
