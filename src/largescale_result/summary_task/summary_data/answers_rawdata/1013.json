    "answer": "In the realm of physiological functions, Mas Takashma provides insight into the dynamics of sneezing. He explains that the sound of a sneeze isn't solely a product of one's physical attributes, such as the resonant throat or lung capacity. Instead, it is also shaped by societal norms and cultural factors. In certain cultures, like Japan, there's a significant emphasis on not inconveniencing others. This cultural norm influences individuals to suppress their sneezes, aiming to minimize the disruption caused to others.\nThe technique to achieve this, Takashma explains, involves minimizing the resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity. In simpler terms, by closing the mouth during a sneeze, the volume can be substantially reduced. This tactic can prove particularly useful in situations where a loud sneeze might be deemed inappropriate or disruptive.\nHowever, medical literature and case studies present a cautionary tale against the suppression of sneezes. For instance, a case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Li√®ge recounts an incident where a man suffered facial pain and swelling after holding back a sneeze. Further medical examination revealed that he had fractured his sinus.\nTakashma concurs with these findings, warning that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical complications. These could range from nosebleeds to potential issues with the eardrum due to the forced redirection of air up the Eustachian tube.\nDespite these potential risks, there are situations where a quieter sneeze is preferable. In such scenarios, Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can effectively reduce the sound, providing a viable alternative when one wishes to avoid drawing attention or causing a commotion."
