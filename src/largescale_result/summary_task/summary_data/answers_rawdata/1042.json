    "answer": "1.Sneezing is a protective mechanism triggered by a sneeze gene, which helps to clear out old cells and particulates from the nasal cavity, thereby protecting the lungs. The process involves a small compound in our nasal cavity and the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. The immune system also plays a role in this process, helping to protect us from viruses.\n\n2.The volume of a sneeze is determined by a multitude of factors including the structure of our respiratory system, the reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and force of the sneeze, and the soft tissues at the back of the throat. Furthermore, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze.\n\n3.Suppressing a sneeze can cause damage to the nose and sinus, but keeping the mouth closed is an effective way to sneeze quietly. Both Dr. Mas Takashma and Professor Sheena Cruikshank provide insights into the importance and mechanism of sneezing."
