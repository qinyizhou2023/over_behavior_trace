    "answer": "Sneezing is a protective reflex triggered by irritants in the nasal cavity, processed by the brain's hippocampus. It helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system against viruses. The sneeze's volume is determined by reflexive muscle contractions and can be influenced by cultural, psychological factors, and societal norms. Holding back a sneeze can damage the nose and sinus."
