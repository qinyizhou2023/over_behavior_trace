    "answer": "The article introduces the topic by discussing the author's personal experience with loud sneezing, sparking curiosity about why some people sneeze louder than others.\n\nFirstly, the article focuses on the biological function of sneezing, with insights from a renowned expert, Dr. Mas Takashma. He explains that sneezing is a crucial mechanism that helps to protect our lungs from particulates. This process is facilitated by a small compound in our nasal cavity which traps particulates. When these particulates build up, they are flushed out through a sneeze, serving as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells.\n\nFurthermore, sneezing also assists the immune system in protecting from viruses. When immune cells in the nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, they activate the sneeze gene. This sneeze signal is then processed by the hippocampus in our brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions.\n\nBesides the biological aspect, the article discusses the factors that influence the volume of a sneeze. According to Dr. Takashma, the structure of our respiratory system, the shape of our vocal cords, and the lung volume are all determining factors in the volume of our sneeze.\n\nHowever, the article points out that cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. Dr. Takashma notes that in Japan, people often suppress their sneezes due to a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others.\n\nDespite this, the article warns about the potential harm of suppressing a sneeze. As Dr. Takashma explains, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. This point is further illustrated by a case study from a hospital in Li√®ge, Belgium.\n\nFinally, the article suggests a solution for those who wish to sneeze quietly. Dr. Takashma recommends keeping the mouth closed as the most effective way to reduce the volume of a sneeze."
