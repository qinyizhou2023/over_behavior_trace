    "answer": "1. The sound of a sneeze comes from the pressure that builds up in the lungs after air was sucked in. The volume of the sneeze also depends on a small compound in the nasal cavity that triggers a sneeze when it is irritated. Specifically, the nose filters air for the lungs and the epithelial cells and tiny hairs and mucus help trap particles before they reach the lungs. Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps to get rid of old cells and protect the immune system from viruses. \n2. Building on the first point, The shape and flexibility of the vocal cords, the amount of air that was sucked into the lungs, and the amount of air that is expelled during a sneeze makes up the volume of our sneeze. All of this is determined my the structure of the respiratory system. The reflexive muscle contractions from the sneeze reflex influences the speed and volume of the sneeze. \n3. Another factor that determines the loudness of our sneeze is cultural and societal factors. Some countries with specific cultural habits that discourage causing inconveniences to others, people tend to avoid sneezing loudly and suppress the sound. There are many potential risks regarding suppressing a sneeze since air could be forced into the Eustachian tube and it can damage or cause issues with the eardrum. On the other hand, people in environments and areas without such societal pressure and habits may not feel the needs to suppress their sneezes and therefore the sound of their sneeze can be louder. The reading also mentioned that a way to sneeze more quietly is to keep the mouth closed. "
