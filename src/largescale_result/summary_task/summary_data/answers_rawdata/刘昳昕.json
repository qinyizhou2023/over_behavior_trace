    "answer": "Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism, helping to flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity. A sneeze gene triggers the process, and this is done by a small compound in our nasal cavity. The signal for a sneeze is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. This response assists our immune system in protecting us from viruses and other potential threats.\n\nThe volume and sound of a sneeze are influenced by various factors, including the structure of our respiratory system and the capacity of our lungs. Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the shape and \"floppiness\" of our vocal cords play a significant role in the sound of our sneezes. However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. In societies where it is culturally important not to inconvenience others, people tend to suppress their sneezes, often by keeping their mouths closed, which is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.\n\nHowever, suppressing a sneeze can cause medical problems. Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, as demonstrated by a case study from a hospital in Liège, Belgium, where a man fractured his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, also highlights that sneezing helps in flushing out the particulates that build up in our noses, further emphasizing the importance of this reflexive action."
