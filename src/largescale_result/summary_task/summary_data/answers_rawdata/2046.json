    "answer": "Sneezing, according to Mas Takashma, is a vital protective mechanism that flushes out particulates from our nose. The sneeze gene, activated by a compound in our nasal cavity, initiates this process when immune cells detect sneeze-inducing compounds. This signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the sneeze's speed. The volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system and societal norms. However, suppressing a sneeze can cause harm, including nose and sinus damage. To sneeze quietly, it's best to keep the mouth closed."
