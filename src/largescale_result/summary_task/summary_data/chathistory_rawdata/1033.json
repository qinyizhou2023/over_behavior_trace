I want you to make a summary of a science article about biology field.

## ChatGPT:
Sure, here's a summary of a biology article about sneezing, a fascinating human reflex.

Sneezing is a complex biological process that starts with the activation of the "sneeze gene". This gene is stimulated by a small compound present in our nasal cavity. The sneeze signal is then processed by the hippocampus in our brain, which triggers the reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. 

Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and potentially harmful particles from our nasal passages. It is also a crucial part of our immune system's defense against viruses. 

However, it's important to note that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. To avoid this, it's recommended to keep the mouth closed, as it's the most effective way to sneeze quietly.

The sound of a sneeze is not only determined by biological factors but also influenced by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. For instance, a study conducted by Takashma revealed that people from different cultures have different sneezing sounds.

The research by Sheena Cruikshank further emphasizes the importance of sneezing in maintaining our overall health.

## 用户:
could you summarise "how does sneeze form" by one sentence?

## ChatGPT:
Certainly, a sneeze forms when the "sneeze gene" is activated by a compound in our nasal cavity, and the signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, triggering reflexive muscle contractions.

Make these into one sentence:Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

## ChatGPT:
Sneezing, an essential bodily function, is initiated when our nasal cavity, a protective air filter for the lungs according to Mas Takashma, traps particulates that need to be flushed out; immune cells in our nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, leading to changes in our nasal lining, as explained by Sheena Cruikshank, and these changes trigger an increase in mucus production, swelling in the nose, and signals sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, which are processed by the hippocampus, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that culminate in a sneeze, irrespective of whether the cause is a virus or grass pollen.

## ChatGPT:
Sneezing is a protective reflex where the "sneeze gene" is activated by particulates in the nasal cavity, causing immune response, changes in the nasal lining, and signals processed by the hippocampus, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that expel the irritants, regardless of their origin.

Forget all the things I gave to you

## ChatGPT:
Sneezing, triggered by a "sneeze gene" and a compound in our nasal cavity, helps protect the body by flushing out old cells and aiding the immune system against viruses, with the sneeze signal processed by the hippocampus in the brain; reflexive muscle contractions determine the speed of the sneeze, and holding back a sneeze may damage the nose and sinus, while keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, and cultural, psychological, and societal norms can influence the sound of a sneeze.

Why do people sneeze loudly

## ChatGPT:
People sneeze loudly primarily due to the reflexive muscle contractions that occur during a sneeze, which determine the speed and force of the sneeze. However, the volume of a sneeze can also be influenced by various factors such as cultural norms, psychological factors, and societal expectations. For instance, some people may unconsciously sneeze more loudly due to learned behavior or to attract attention. Conversely, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.

## ChatGPT:
The loudness of a sneeze is determined by reflexive muscle contractions and can be influenced by cultural, psychological, and societal factors. Keeping the mouth closed can make the sneeze quieter.

## 用户:
How can I reduce my sneeze volume

## ChatGPT:
You can reduce the volume of your sneeze by keeping your mouth closed during the sneeze. However, be careful not to suppress the sneeze completely as it may damage the surface of your nose and sinus, as sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and protect from viruses.

## ChatGPT:
To reduce sneeze volume, keep your mouth closed when sneezing, but avoid suppressing it completely to prevent nasal and sinus damage.

## 用户:
Why people wants to keep sneeze quietly

## ChatGPT:
People may want to sneeze quietly due to societal norms and cultural factors, as loud sneezing can be seen as disruptive or impolite in certain settings. Additionally, psychological factors may also influence a person's desire to sneeze quietly to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

## 用户:
What is the disadvantage of quietly sneeze

## ChatGPT:
While quietly sneezing can be more socially acceptable, it's important to note that holding back a sneeze may potentially cause damage to the surface of the nose and sinus. Sneezing is a natural protective mechanism that helps to expel irritants from the nasal cavity and support the immune system in protecting against viruses. Suppressing it could interfere with these beneficial effects.

## 用户:
What can I do next time if I want to sneeze quietly but not offend my health?

## ChatGPT:
To sneeze quietly without harming your health, you can try to sneeze into a tissue or your elbow to muffle the sound. This way, you're not suppressing the sneeze, which could potentially damage your nose and sinus, but you're also not sneezing loudly. Remember, sneezing is a natural reflex that helps clear out irritants and supports the immune system in protecting against viruses.
