# 打喷嚏的原因

## 用户:
there is a article, I need you write a summary more than 200 words. Assume you are a bio student at university. use english.
When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## ChatGPT:
Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism. A sneeze is induced when the sneeze gene gets activated by a small compound present in our nasal cavity. This helps in flushing out old cells and particulates from our body, thus keeping our lungs clean. The process is facilitated by a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus in our nose. According to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, sneezing also helps our immune system protect us from viruses.

When the immune cells in our nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, they trigger an immune response. This causes changes in the lining of our nose, leading to symptoms like increased mucus production and swelling. These signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve and are processed by the hippocampus, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions. These contractions determine the speed of the sneeze.

However, the volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat. Lung volume also plays a role in determining the amount of air that enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze. But, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

Suppressing a sneeze, while it may seem polite, can actually cause medical issues such as nose bleeds and sinus fractures. This is because holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. However, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, as suggested by Takashma. This reduces the volume of the sneeze and minimizes the potential disruption caused by a loud sneeze.

## ChatGPT:
Sneezing is an essential protective mechanism that our bodies employ to maintain respiratory health. It is triggered by a specific "sneeze gene" and activated by a small compound present in our nasal cavity. This process helps to expel old cells and particulates, effectively protecting our lungs. Furthermore, sneezing aids our immune system in its ongoing battle against viral intruders. The signal to sneeze is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, which then leads to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of the sneeze.

The volume and sound of a sneeze are influenced by various factors. The structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords, plays a significant role. However, it's not just biological factors that have an impact. Societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological influences can also affect the sound of a sneeze, making it a more complex phenomenon than it might initially appear.

Suppressing a sneeze, while often seen as a matter of courtesy or politeness, can cause medical issues. These can range from damage to the nose and sinus surfaces to more serious complications such as nosebleeds and sinus fractures. To avoid these risks, it is recommended to sneeze with the mouth closed. This approach allows for a quieter sneeze without compromising health. Therefore, understanding the science behind sneezing can help us appreciate its importance and manage it effectively.
