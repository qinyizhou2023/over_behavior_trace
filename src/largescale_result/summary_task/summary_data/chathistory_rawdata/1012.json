Understood. Here's a draft of a scientific abstract:

Sneezing is a fascinating physiological process, often underestimated. Recent studies have identified the existence of a "sneeze gene" that drives this reflex. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, triggered by a small compound present in our nasal cavity. The process is more intricate than it appears, with reflexive muscle contractions determining the sneeze's speed. 

Sneezing has been identified as a protective mechanism that aids in flushing out old cells from our nasal cavity. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in our immune system, protecting us from viruses by expelling them with force. 

However, holding back a sneeze may lead to potential damage to the nose and sinus surfaces. Therefore, it's recommended to let the sneeze out, albeit quietly, by keeping the mouth closed. 

The sound of a sneeze, interestingly, is influenced by various factors. Cultural aspects, psychological factors, and societal norms shape the way we sneeze, making it a unique, individualistic expression. 

This study, led by Sheena Cruikshank, suggests that a deeper understanding of sneezing could lead to advancements in treating respiratory diseases. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of sneezing in maintaining overall health, urging us to respect our body's natural responses.

## Message From You:
Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

## Message From ChatGPT:
The volume of a person's sneeze can be influenced by several factors. One of these is the reflexive muscle contractions that occur during a sneeze, which can determine the speed and force of the sneeze, and thus contribute to its volume. 

Additionally, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, some people may unconsciously suppress their sneezes to avoid drawing attention, resulting in quieter sneezes, while others may not inhibit their sneezes, leading to louder sneezes.

It's also worth noting that the way a person sneezes is unique to them, much like other bodily functions. However, if a person is consistently sneezing loudly, it might be due to the way their body is built. For example, they might have a larger nasal cavity or stronger abdominal muscles, both of which could contribute to louder sneezes.

Lastly, it's important to remember that holding back a sneeze can potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinus, so it's generally better to let it out. If one wants to sneeze quietly, the most effective way is to keep the mouth closed during the sneeze.

## Message From You:
When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is a vital bodily function that serves to protect our lungs by flushing out particulates trapped by the mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus in our nasal cavity. The sneeze is triggered when immune cells in our nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. According to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, and Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, these immune cells generate chemicals that cause changes in our nasal lining, leading to increased mucus production and swelling. 

The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, which then results in reflexive muscle contractions. This process, combined with the shape and flexibility of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat, as well as the volume of our lungs, determines the sound and volume of our sneeze. 

However, cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, where there is a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes by minimizing the amount of resonant energy flowing through their oral cavity, essentially by keeping their mouth closed. 

However, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nose bleeds and even a fractured sinus, as evidenced by a case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège. Therefore, while keeping your mouth closed during a sneeze can help reduce its volume, it's crucial to not completely suppress it. 

In summary, sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting from viruses. The volume of a sneeze is determined by a combination of physiological and sociocultural factors, and while it can be moderated to some extent, it should not be suppressed due to the potential risk of injury.

## Message From ChatGPT:
Sneezing is a critical physiological function with a significant protective role. It serves to safeguard our lungs by expelling particulates that have become trapped within the nasal cavity. This process is initiated by immune cells within the nose that detect specific compounds. The presence of these compounds triggers changes in the nasal lining, including increased mucus production and swelling. These changes are part of the body's natural defense mechanism to flush out old cells and protect against viruses. 

The sneeze signal is then processed by a specific region in our brain, the hippocampus. This leads to reflexive muscle contractions which determine the speed and force of the sneeze. The sound and volume of a sneeze are influenced by several physiological factors. These include the structure and flexibility of our vocal cords, the volume of our lungs, and the presence of other soft tissues within the throat. 

However, the volume and sound of a sneeze are not solely determined by physiological factors. Societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological influences also play a significant role. For example, in Japan, societal norms encourage individuals to suppress their sneezes to avoid causing inconvenience to others. This is typically achieved by keeping the mouth closed, which effectively reduces the volume of the sneeze. 

Yet, it's important to note that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical complications. These can range from minor issues such as nose bleeds to more serious problems like a fractured sinus. Therefore, while it's possible to moderate the volume of a sneeze, it's critical not to suppress it entirely due to the potential health risks involved. 

In conclusion, sneezing is a protective mechanism that serves a vital role in our body's defense system. It aids in flushing out old cells and protecting against viruses. The volume and sound of a sneeze are determined by a complex interplay of physiological and sociocultural factors. While it's possible to moderate the volume of a sneeze, it should never be suppressed due to the potential health risks. Understanding these dynamics provides insight into the importance of sneezing as a natural protective reflex and the influence of biology and culture in how we express this reflex.
