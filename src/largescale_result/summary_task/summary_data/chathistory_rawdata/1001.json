Why do some people sneeze so loudly?


When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## ChatGPT:
This paper explores the reasons behind the loudness of some people's sneezes and the physiological and societal factors that influence it. Firstly, sneezing is a crucial bodily function, serving as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and particulates to protect the lungs. The sneeze gene triggers this action, which is done by a small compound in our nasal cavity. This signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of a sneeze.

Secondly, the structure of our respiratory system, particularly the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat, influences the volume of our sneezes. Holding back a sneeze can potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinus, as evidenced by a case study where a man fractured his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. It's also noted that sneezing helps the immune system in protecting us from viruses.

Lastly, the sound of a sneeze isn't purely physiological. Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, where there's a heavy emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. However, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, according to Dr. Takashma. This paper thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the loudness of sneezes, encompassing both biological and societal aspects.

Is the first one a reason? I think the second is related to the physiological aspect and the third one related to the cultural aspect. The first one seems to be an introduction to the phenomenon.


## ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right, my apologies for the confusion. Let's refine the three points:

1. The physiological aspect: The loudness of a sneeze is primarily determined by the structure of our respiratory system. Specifically, the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat play a crucial role. The process begins with a deep inhalation, and once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled, creating the sound of the sneeze. The sneeze gene triggers this action, which is done by a small compound in our nasal cavity. This signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of a sneeze. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and particulates to protect the lungs. It also aids the immune system in protecting us from viruses.

2. The potential risks of suppressing a sneeze: Holding back a sneeze can potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinus. This is evidenced by a case study where a man fractured his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. 

3. The influence of societal and cultural factors: The sound of a sneeze is also influenced by societal norms and cultural factors. For instance, in Japan, where there's a heavy emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. However, according to Dr. Takashma, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly. 

This paper thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the loudness of sneezes, encompassing both biological and societal aspects.

Please reorganize the language and make it into a paragraph at around 300 words.


## ChatGPT:
Sneezing, a critical bodily function, is primarily influenced by the structure of our respiratory system. The sneeze gene, activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity, initiates the sneezing process. The signal is then processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and intensity of a sneeze. The sound of the sneeze is produced when air, built up in our lungs through deep inhalation, is expelled through our vocal cords and soft tissue in the throat. This process serves as a protective mechanism, helping to flush out old cells and particulates, consequently safeguarding our lungs and aiding the immune system in virus protection.

However, suppressing a sneeze can pose health risks, potentially damaging the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study highlighted a man who fractured his sinus after holding back a sneeze, underscoring the potential dangers of sneeze suppression.

The volume of a sneeze isn't solely determined by physiological factors; societal norms and cultural influences also play a significant role. For instance, in societies like Japan, where not inconveniencing others is highly valued, people tend to suppress their sneezes. Despite the potential risks, there are safer ways to minimize the volume of a sneeze. Dr. Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can effectively reduce its sound. Thus, the loudness of sneezes is a complex phenomenon, shaped by both biological and societal factors.
