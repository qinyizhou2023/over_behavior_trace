the title is why do some people sneeze so loudly?

## Message From ChatGPT:
The phenomenon of sneezing varies in volume due to a multitude of factors. Sneezing is a reflexive response controlled by a gene, often referred to as the 'sneeze gene'. This reaction is triggered by a small compound present in our nasal cavity. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and volume of the sneeze. 

Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that aids in flushing out old cells, thus helping the immune system in protecting from viruses. However, the way we sneeze can be influenced by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. 

It's also worth noting that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. Therefore, the most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. This information has been verified by renowned researcher Sheena Cruikshank.

Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out. There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions. This all leads to a sneeze.
But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.
Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “
You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

## Message From ChatGPT:
Sneezing is a crucial bodily function, primarily serving as an air filter for the lungs, according to Mas Takashma. The nasal cavity, composed of a dense network of epithelial cells, minuscule hairs, and viscous mucus, functions to trap particulates, thereby safeguarding the lungs. When these particulates accumulate, they necessitate expulsion. 

The nose also houses immune cells that become activated upon detecting elevated levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. As Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains, the chemicals produced during this immune response cause alterations in the nasal lining. This leads to increased mucus production, nasal swelling, and the transmission of signals to the brain via the trigeminal nerve. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions and ultimately, a sneeze.

However, the cause of the sneeze, be it a virus or grass pollen, does not influence the volume of the sneeze. The volume is instead determined by the structure of our respiratory system. The initial step of the sneeze reflex involves deep inhalation. As air is drawn into the lungs, the vocal cords close tightly. Once sufficient pressure has been accumulated in the lungs, the air is expelled. The rush of air passing through the vocal cords generates the sneeze sound. 

The shape and laxity of the vocal cords and other soft tissues in the throat influence whether a sneeze is quiet or loud. Additionally, lung volume also affects the amount of air entering and exiting our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement can predict sneeze volume. Interestingly, individuals with large lung volumes can have very petite sneezes. 

Sneezing also serves as a protective mechanism, flushing out old cells and aiding the immune system in virus protection. It's important to note that suppressing a sneeze could potentially damage the nasal and sinus surfaces. The most effective method to sneeze quietly is to keep the mouth closed. Cultural, psychological, and societal factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

"Can I blame my resonant throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.
Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured his sinus. Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube, possibly causing issues with your eardrum.”
But the next time you find a dust mote tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”"

## Message From ChatGPT:
Takashma elucidates that the sound of a sneeze isn't solely dependent on one's physical attributes but is also influenced by societal norms and cultural factors. For example, in Japan, there's a cultural emphasis on not causing inconvenience to others, leading many to suppress their sneezes. The key to this is minimizing the resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, simply put, closing the mouth, which can reduce the volume of a sneeze. 

However, medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may cause health issues. A case study recounts a man who experienced facial pain and swelling after holding back a sneeze, which led to a sinus fracture. Takashma confirms that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical complications such as nose bleeds and potential eardrum issues due to forced air up the Eustachian tube. 

Nonetheless, there are situations where a quiet sneeze is preferable. Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can achieve this, providing a viable alternative when one wishes to avoid causing a commotion.

In the realm of physiological functions, Mas Takashma provides insight into the dynamics of sneezing. He explains that the sound of a sneeze isn't solely a product of one's physical attributes, such as the resonant throat or lung capacity. Instead, it is also shaped by societal norms and cultural factors. In certain cultures, like Japan, there's a significant emphasis on not inconveniencing others. This cultural norm influences individuals to suppress their sneezes, aiming to minimize the disruption caused to others.

The technique to achieve this, Takashma explains, involves minimizing the resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity. In simpler terms, by closing the mouth during a sneeze, the volume can be substantially reduced. This tactic can prove particularly useful in situations where a loud sneeze might be deemed inappropriate or disruptive.

However, medical literature and case studies present a cautionary tale against the suppression of sneezes. For instance, a case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège recounts an incident where a man suffered facial pain and swelling after holding back a sneeze. Further medical examination revealed that he had fractured his sinus.

Takashma concurs with these findings, warning that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical complications. These could range from nosebleeds to potential issues with the eardrum due to the forced redirection of air up the Eustachian tube.

Despite these potential risks, there are situations where a quieter sneeze is preferable. In such scenarios, Takashma suggests that keeping the mouth closed during a sneeze can effectively reduce the sound, providing a viable alternative when one wishes to avoid drawing attention or causing a commotion.
