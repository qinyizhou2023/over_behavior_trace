# Understanding the Science of Sneezing

## Message From You:
summarize this reading into 3 points:

When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## Message From ChatGPT:
1. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism for the body, helping to flush out old cells and particulates from the nasal cavity. This is facilitated by a sneeze gene and a small compound in our nasal cavity. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. The immune system also benefits from sneezing, as it aids in protecting from viruses.

2. The volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system and the amount of air that enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze. Factors such as the shape of our vocal cords and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. According to Dr. Takashma, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

3. Holding back a sneeze can potentially cause damage to the surface of the nose and sinus, as demonstrated by a case study where a man fractured his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. However, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly and avoid causing a scene or disturbing others. Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchester's Division of Immunology also states that the causes of sneezing vary, and a virus should not produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen.

## Message From You:
they also mentioned the societal and cultural habits that influences people from sneezing loudly


## Message From ChatGPT:
Yes, you're right. The societal and cultural norms play a significant role in the volume of a sneeze. Dr. Takashma highlights that in societies where there is a strong emphasis on not inconveniencing others, such as in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes. This is often achieved by minimizing the amount of resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, or in simpler terms, keeping the mouth closed while sneezing. However, it's worth noting that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues, hence why it's advised to sneeze in a way that's respectful to others but also safe for oneself.

the 3 main points needs to answer why do people sneeze loudly

## Message From ChatGPT:
1. Biological Factors: The volume of a sneeze is primarily determined by biological factors. The sneeze gene, which causes a small compound in our nasal cavity to trigger a sneeze, is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. This leads to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and volume of the sneeze. The sneeze serves as a protective mechanism, flushing out old cells and aiding the immune system in protecting against viruses. 

2. Physical Characteristics: The structure of our respiratory system, including the shape of our vocal cords and the amount of air that enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, also significantly influences the volume of a sneeze. Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, while keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.

3. Cultural and Societal Factors: The sound of a sneeze can also be influenced by cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors. In societies where causing inconvenience to others is discouraged, people tend to suppress their sneezes, which can lead to medical issues. Despite the potential risks, Professor Sheena Cruikshank suggests that keeping the mouth closed is the safest way to sneeze quietly.

## Message From You:
using the reading i provided, why do we sneeze loud some times and sneeze quiet other times?


## Message From ChatGPT:
The volume of our sneezes can vary due to a combination of biological, physical, and environmental factors.

1. Biological Factors: Our bodies contain a 'sneeze gene' that responds to irritants in our nasal cavity. When triggered, this gene signals the hippocampus in our brain, which processes the sneeze and initiates reflexive muscle contractions. These contractions determine the speed and, consequently, the volume of the sneeze. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and supports the immune system in protecting from viruses. 

2. Physical Characteristics: The structure of our respiratory system and vocal cords also play a part. The amount of air that enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze can significantly influence the volume. Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, potentially leading to louder sneezes in the future. Conversely, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.

3. Environmental Factors: The volume of our sneezes can also be influenced by our surroundings and societal norms. Cultural and psychological factors can cause us to suppress or amplify our sneezes, affecting their volume. For instance, in a quiet library, we might subconsciously try to sneeze more quietly to avoid disturbing others. Conversely, if we're alone or in a noisy environment, we might allow ourselves to sneeze more loudly. 

In conclusion, the volume of our sneezes is not static but can change based on a variety of factors, including our biological makeup, physical characteristics, and the environment in which we find ourselves.

## Message From You:
since my physical characteristics and biological factors dont change, why doesnt my sneeze sound the same all the time?

## Message From ChatGPT:
While it's true that your physical characteristics and biological factors remain relatively constant, the volume and sound of your sneeze can still vary due to a few reasons.

Firstly, the intensity of the sneeze can be influenced by the amount of irritants in your nasal cavity. A higher concentration of irritants can trigger a stronger sneeze, leading to a louder sound. This is due to the activation of the sneeze gene, which processes the sneeze signal in the hippocampus of the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions. 

Secondly, the way you sneeze can change based on your conscious and subconscious efforts to control it. For instance, if you're in a public place, you might subconsciously try to sneeze more quietly to avoid drawing attention, which can be achieved by keeping your mouth closed. Conversely, if you're alone or in a noisy environment, you might allow yourself to sneeze more loudly. This is influenced by societal norms and psychological factors.

Lastly, holding back a sneeze can potentially damage the surface of your nose and sinuses, which could alter the sound of subsequent sneezes. On the other hand, regular sneezing helps to flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting from viruses, which could potentially affect the sound of your sneezes over time.

Therefore, even though your physical and biological factors might not change significantly, the sound of your sneeze can still vary based on the level of irritants, your conscious or subconscious control over the sneeze, and the health of your nasal cavity and sinuses.

Here's an improved version of your summary:

1. The sound of a sneeze originates from the pressure that accumulates in the lungs after inhaling air. The volume of the sneeze also relies on a small compound in the nasal cavity, which activates the 'sneeze gene' when irritated. This gene signals the hippocampus in the brain, triggering a sneeze as a protective mechanism to flush out old cells and support the immune system against viruses.

2. Building on the first point, the structure and flexibility of the vocal cords, along with the volume of air inhaled into the lungs and expelled during a sneeze, contribute to the volume of the sneeze. These factors are determined by the structure of the respiratory system. Reflexive muscle contractions, initiated by the sneeze reflex, determine the speed and volume of the sneeze. It's worth noting that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, potentially impacting future sneeze sounds.

3. Cultural, psychological, and societal factors also play a significant role in determining the loudness of our sneeze. In societies where cultural norms discourage causing inconvenience to others, people tend to suppress their sneezes, resulting in quieter sneezes. Conversely, in more relaxed environments, sneezes may be louder. Keeping the mouth closed is an effective way to sneeze quietly, further demonstrating how individual control can influence sneeze volume.
