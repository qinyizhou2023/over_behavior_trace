# Understanding the Science of Sneezing

When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## Message From ChatGPT:
- Sneezing, triggered by a "sneeze gene" and a small compound in our nasal cavity, is a vital process that helps to flush out old cells and protect the lungs from particulates, according to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. It also helps the immune system in protecting from viruses.
- The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and the volume of our lungs. However, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes due to cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others.
- Suppressing a sneeze can potentially cause damage to the surface of the nose and sinus, as evidenced by a case study of a man who fractured his sinus by holding back a sneeze. However, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, as suggested by Takashma. Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchester's Division of Immunology also affirms that there's no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen.

- Sneezing, which is activated by a specific gene and a minor component in our nose, is crucial for our health. It helps get rid of old cells and defends our lungs from harmful particles, as explained by Mas Takashma from Houston Methodist Academic Institute. The sneeze impulse is processed by our brain's hippocampus, causing muscles to contract reflexively, which defines the sneeze's speed. Sneezing also aids our immune system in fighting off viruses.
- The loudness of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung capacity. However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological aspects can also affect how loud a sneeze is. For example, in Japan, people often suppress their sneezes due to a cultural emphasis on not disturbing others.
- Holding back a sneeze can cause harm to the nose and sinus, as demonstrated by a case where a man fractured his sinus by suppressing a sneeze. However, the most effective method to sneeze quietly is to keep the mouth closed, as suggested by Takashma. Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchester's Division of Immunology also states that a virus doesn't necessarily cause a louder sneeze than grass pollen.

- Suppressing a sneeze can potentially cause damage to the nose and sinus. However, keeping the mouth closed while sneezing can help reduce the volume of the sneeze without causing harm. Regardless of the cause of the sneeze, be it a virus or pollen, the volume of the sneeze does not necessarily differ.

1) Sneezing is a critical bodily function that helps protect human's lungs from harmful particles and supports human's immune systems. Inside our nose are cells that protect our lungs by trapping particles that might damage them. However, as the particulates build up, eventually they need to come up. Thus, the urge to sneeze is triggered. and processed by our brains, eventually leading to a muscle contraction we call a sneeze. There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. 
2) The volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung capacity. The first step of any sneeze is a deep inhale, which could look different from person to person. Furthermore, cultural norms, societal factors, and psychological influences can also shape the sound of a sneeze. In some cultures, such as Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes to avoid disturbing others.
3) Suppressing a sneeze can be bad for the person sneezing.

While for the most part, people who keep their mouths shut during a sneeze will be fine, there are case studies such as the one in Belgium during the peak of the coronavirus, where a man who suppressed his sneeze ended up fracturing his sinus. Nosebleeds and eardrum issues are also potential negative effects of suppressing a sneeze.
