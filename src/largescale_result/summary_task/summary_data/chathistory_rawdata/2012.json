# Understanding Loud Sneezes Causes Effects

## Message From You:
Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is a crucial body function that serves to protect our lungs by expelling particulates that have been trapped by the mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus in our nose. This process is detailed by Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. He explains that when these particulates build up, they need to be flushed out, which is facilitated by a sneeze. 

In addition to this, there are immune cells in our nose that activate upon detecting high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains that these immune responses cause changes in the lining of our nose, leading to increased mucus production, swelling, and the sending of signals to our brain via the trigeminal nerve. This sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that lead to a sneeze. 

The volume of a sneeze, however, is not determined by its cause but by the structure of our respiratory system. This involves deep inhalation, closure of our vocal cords, and the expulsion of air. The sound of a sneeze is created by the gush of air pushing through the vocal cords. Factors such as the shape and floppiness of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume, influence the volume of our sneezes. 

However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, Takashma points out that in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes due to a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others. This is done by minimizing the amount of resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, essentially by keeping the mouth closed, which reduces the volume of the sneeze.

It's important to note, however, that suppressing a sneeze can cause medical issues such as nose bleeds and sinus damage, as demonstrated by a case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège. Therefore, it's recommended to sneeze naturally when possible. However, if you need to sneeze quietly, keeping your mouth closed can help. 

In conclusion, sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting from viruses. The sound of a sneeze is determined by various factors, including the structure of our respiratory system, reflexive muscle contractions, and cultural and societal norms. It's also worth noting that there is a sneeze gene, and this process is facilitated by a small compound in our nasal cavity.

Sure, I understand. Here's a concise summary:

Sneezing is a crucial body function, serving as a protective mechanism that helps flush out particulates from our nose, thereby protecting our lungs. This action is facilitated by a small compound in our nasal cavity and is encoded by a sneeze gene. The process involves immune responses, increased mucus production, and signals to the brain, specifically processed by the hippocampus, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions. 

The volume of a sneeze is determined not by its cause, but by the structure of our respiratory system, including deep inhalation, vocal cord closure, and the expulsion of air. The sound of a sneeze is influenced by the shape and floppiness of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume. 

Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes to avoid inconveniencing others, achieved by keeping the mouth closed to minimize sound. However, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues, such as nosebleeds or sinus damage. While sneezing serves an essential protective function, those wishing to minimize noise can do so by sneezing with their mouth closed. 

In conclusion, sneezing is a complex reflex influenced by biological, anatomical, and cultural factors.
