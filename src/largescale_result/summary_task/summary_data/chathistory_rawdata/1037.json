# Task 1

## Message From You:
Hello! I need to write a summary of this text: When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that helps to protect the lungs by trapping particles in the nasal cavity, which is made up of a mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus. This is done by a small compound in our nasal cavity. The trapped particles are then expelled through the process of sneezing, which is triggered by the sneeze gene and processed by the hippocampus in the brain. 

According to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, the nose acts as an air filter. Immune cells in our nose detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, leading to changes in the nose lining, increased mucus production, and swelling. These changes are familiar to anyone who has experienced a pollen-filled summer or a phlegmy winter. 

Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains that the sneeze signal is sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve and results in reflexive muscle contractions, which determine the speed of the sneeze. Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and helps the immune system in protecting from viruses. 

The volume of a sneeze is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung volume, but is not determined by the cause of the sneeze. Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. 

Takashma points out that in cultures where there is an emphasis on not disturbing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes. However, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. The most effective way to sneeze quietly is to keep the mouth closed.

Certainly, the article does highlight potential risks associated with suppressing a sneeze. It mentions a case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège, where a 38-year-old man experienced pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon examination, it was revealed that he had fractured his sinus, demonstrating that suppressing a sneeze can lead to serious medical issues.

Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, also cautions against this practice. He explains that by suppressing a sneeze, you can cause medical issues such as nosebleeds. The forceful air from a suppressed sneeze can travel up the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the nose, potentially causing problems with your eardrum. 

While it's understandable that people might want to suppress their sneezes in certain situations to avoid causing a disturbance, the potential risks to health mean it's not a good idea to make a habit of it. Instead, Takashma suggests keeping your mouth closed when you sneeze as a way to reduce the volume without causing harm.

Sneezing is a vital function for our body, triggered by a specific gene and facilitated by a compound in our nasal cavity, which aids in protecting our lungs by trapping particles. This complex process involves a network of epithelial cells, minuscule hairs, and thick mucus in our nose. Mas Takashma, the head of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, likens the nose to an air filter. 

Our nasal immune cells are on alert for high concentrations of sneeze-inducing compounds. When detected, these cells initiate changes in the nose lining, leading to increased mucus production and swelling. This response is common in instances like a pollen-rich summer or a phlegmy winter. Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, adds that the sneeze signal is conveyed to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, triggering reflexive muscle contractions. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism, helping to expel old cells and assisting the immune system in defending against viruses.

The volume of a sneeze is impacted by the structure of our respiratory system, including our vocal cords and lung capacity. However, the cause of the sneeze does not influence its volume. The sound of a sneeze can also be affected by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. 

Takashma notes that in societies where disturbing others is frowned upon, people tend to suppress their sneezes. However, this can be harmful, potentially damaging the surface of the nose and sinus. The most effective way to reduce the volume of a sneeze, he suggests, is by keeping the mouth closed, which allows the sneeze to occur naturally without causing potential harm.
