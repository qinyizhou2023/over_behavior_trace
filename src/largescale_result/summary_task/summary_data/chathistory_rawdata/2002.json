# Understanding Loud Sneezes Causes Effects

## Message From You:
When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is a crucial bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism to flush out old cells and trapped particulates in the nasal cavity, thereby preventing them from reaching the lungs. This is facilitated by a sneeze gene and a small compound present in our nasal cavity. Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the nose acts as an air filter for the lungs, capturing particulates with a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus.

Our nasal cavity also houses immune cells that respond to high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. According to Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, these compounds lead to changes in the nose lining, causing increased mucus production, swelling, and sneeze signals sent to the brain. Contrary to common belief, the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions, which determine the speed of the sneeze.

Sneezing also plays a role in the immune system's protection from viruses. However, the volume of a sneeze is not determined by the cause of the sneeze, such as a virus or grass pollen. Instead, it is influenced by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and the volume of our lungs. 

Interestingly, the sound of a sneeze can also be influenced by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. For instance, in societies where there is an emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to sneeze quietly by closing their mouths, which is the most effective way to sneeze quietly. 

However, it's important to note that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. Therefore, while it may be socially acceptable to suppress a sneeze in certain situations, one should be cautious not to cause potential harm to their health by doing so.

## Message From ChatGPT:
While it seems like the text is not directly related to travel planning, it does provide some insights that could be useful for a travel plan. If you're someone who sneezes loudly and frequently, you might want to consider these factors when planning your trip.

1. Destination: Choose a destination where loud sneezing is not culturally frowned upon. The text mentions that in Japan, there is a societal norm to suppress sneezes. If you're not comfortable with this, you may want to consider other destinations.

2. Accommodation: If your sneezes are loud enough to wobble windows and awaken sleeping animals, it might be considerate to look for private accommodation rather than shared or communal spaces.

3. Medical Precautions: The text mentions that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as sinus fractures and nosebleeds. So, it's crucial to ensure you have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies. 

4. Packing: As sneezing helps protect your immune system from viruses and flushes out old cells, you might want to pack tissues, hand sanitizers, and any medication you usually take for allergies or colds.

5. Activities: If you're likely to sneeze in response to certain triggers, like dust or pollen, plan your activities accordingly. For example, if you're allergic to pollen, you might want to avoid outdoor activities during the high-pollen season.

Remember, the goal is to ensure that your travel plan is both accurate and reasonable, taking into consideration your personal needs and comfort.
