## Message From You:
I have an article about: "Why do some people sneeze so loudly?" and I'd like you to help me make a comprehensive summary that is accurate and reasonable. Keep the structure of the original text. First give a summary for each paragraph without neglecting any information.

When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”



## Message From ChatGPT:
The article begins by questioning why some people sneeze so loudly. It then proceeds to explain the importance of sneezing as a bodily function. According to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, our nose acts as an air filter for our lungs. Inside our nose, a combination of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus traps particulates to protect the lungs. When these particulates accumulate, they need to be eliminated, which is facilitated by sneezing. This process is influenced by a small compound in our nasal cavity.

The article also mentions that there are populations of immune cells in our nose. These cells become active when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains that the immune response to these compounds causes changes in our nose lining, leading to symptoms like increased mucus production and swelling. These signals are sent to the brain through the trigeminal nerve, and the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus. This results in reflexive muscle contractions, leading to a sneeze. Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and also aids the immune system in protecting us from viruses.

The volume of a sneeze, however, is determined by the structure of our respiratory system. The sneeze reflex involves deep inhalation, and the sound of the sneeze is created when the air is expelled through the vocal cords. The shape and flexibility of our vocal cords and other soft tissues in the throat, as well as lung volume, influence the volume of a sneeze.

Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For instance, in Japan, where not inconveniencing others is a cultural norm, people tend to suppress their sneezes. Takashma suggests that the most effective way to reduce sneeze volume is to keep the mouth closed during a sneeze.

However, suppressing a sneeze can be harmful. Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study from a hospital in Liège, Belgium, reported a man fracturing his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. Takashma also warns that suppressing a sneeze can cause nose bleeds and possibly issues with the eardrum. But keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly, especially in situations where a loud sneeze would be inappropriate.

## Message From ChatGPT:
The article starts by investigating the reason behind the loudness of some people's sneezes. It emphasizes that sneezing is a crucial physiological function, with our nose serving as an air filter for the lungs. This process involves a complex system of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and mucus that work together to trap particulates. The sneezing mechanism is influenced by a small compound in our nasal cavity, which helps to flush out these particulates.

The presence of immune cells in our nose plays a significant role in this process. These cells activate upon detecting high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. The ensuing immune response triggers changes in our nasal lining, resulting in increased mucus production and swelling. This sneeze signal is then processed by the hippocampus in our brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions. Thus, sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that aids in flushing out old cells and supporting the immune system in its defense against viruses.

The volume of a sneeze is largely determined by the structure of our respiratory system. Factors such as the shape and flexibility of our vocal cords, along with our lung volume, influence the loudness of a sneeze. However, it's not just physiological factors at play here. Cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological influences can also impact the sound of a sneeze.

In societies like Japan, where there's a strong cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes, often by keeping their mouths closed. Despite this, it's important to note that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues. These can range from sinus fractures to nosebleeds, as the pressure from a suppressed sneeze can damage the surface of the nose and sinuses.

In conclusion, while keeping the mouth closed can help reduce the volume of a sneeze in quieter situations, it's essential to be cautious about suppressing sneezes altogether due to the potential health risks involved.
