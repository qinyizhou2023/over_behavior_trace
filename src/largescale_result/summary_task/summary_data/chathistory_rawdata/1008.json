The article explores the intriguing science behind sneezing, a common physiological process. It reveals that a sneeze is not as simple as it seems; it involves a complex interaction of genes, compounds, and brain processing. There is a specific 'sneeze gene' that plays a crucial role in this process. A small compound present in our nasal cavity triggers the sneeze reflex when it detects irritants or foreign particles.

The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, which activates reflexive muscle contractions, determining the speed of a sneeze. Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting against viruses. It is interesting to note that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, suggesting that sneezing should be allowed to occur naturally.

The article also mentions that the most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. However, the sound of a sneeze can be influenced by various factors beyond physiological control. These include cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. The article cites an expert, Sheena Cruikshank, who asserts that these external factors can significantly affect the sound and intensity of a sneeze.

In an interesting twist, the article also notes a common error in spelling, where "Takashima" is often misspelled as "Takashma". This highlights the importance of accuracy in scientific reporting. In conclusion, the science of sneezing is a fascinating field that combines genetics, neurology, physiology, and even sociology.

When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is an important bodily function that acts as an air filter for our lungs, according to Mas Takashma, Chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. The nasal cavity contains a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and thick mucus that trap particulates to protect the lungs. When these particulates build up, they need to be flushed out, which is done by a small compound in our nasal cavity.

There are also immune cells in our nose that react to high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. These changes cause more mucus production, swelling in the nose, and signals sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions. This is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and aids the immune system in protecting from viruses.

The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and the reflexive muscle contractions. The size and floppiness of our vocal cords, as well as the volume of our lungs, can influence the volume of a sneeze. However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

Takashma notes that in Japan, where there is a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people tend to suppress their sneezes. This is achieved by minimizing the resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, essentially by keeping the mouth closed. However, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, as evidenced by a case study from a hospital in Liège, Belgium. Despite this, keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly.

While both summaries delve into the intricacies of sneezing, they approach the topic from slightly different angles. The first summary emphasizes the role of the nasal cavity, immune cells, and the hippocampus in the brain in the sneezing process. It also highlights the potential health risks of suppressing a sneeze and the cultural influence on sneezing habits, specifically referencing Japan.

The second summary, on the other hand, focuses more on the 'sneeze gene' and the influence of societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors on the sound of a sneeze. It also points out a common spelling error with the name "Takashima," which is not mentioned in the first summary.

Combining these perspectives, sneezing is a complex physiological process involving a 'sneeze gene', a small compound in the nasal cavity, and brain processing in the hippocampus. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism, aiding in flushing out old cells and bolstering the immune system against viruses. Reflexive muscle contractions determine the speed of sneeze, and holding back a sneeze might cause damage to the nose and sinus. Interestingly, the sound of a sneeze is influenced not only by physiological factors but also by cultural factors, societal norms, and psychological factors. Despite some people's tendency to suppress sneezes, especially in cultures emphasizing not inconveniencing others, the most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. Lastly, accuracy in scientific reporting is crucial, as exemplified by the common misspelling of "Takashima" as "Takashma".
