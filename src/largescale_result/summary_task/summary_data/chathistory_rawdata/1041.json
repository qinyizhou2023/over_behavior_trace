So the the task is about : "Why do some people sneeze so loudly?" And the whole text is: "When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”"

Sure, here's a summary of the article separated into four points:

1. Sneezing is a vital bodily function that helps to protect the lungs by filtering the air we breathe. The process is initiated by a small compound in our nasal cavity, which is a tight mesh of epithelial cells, tiny hairs, and mucus, as explained by Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. This mesh traps particulates to protect the lungs and when these particulates build up, they need to be flushed out, which is done by sneezing. 

2. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. It’s these contractions that lead to a sneeze. According to Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and support the immune system in protecting from viruses. 

3. The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and the amount of air that is expelled during the sneeze. The shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether we have a quiet or booming sneeze. However, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

4. Lastly, it's important to note that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. Keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly. However, suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nose bleeds and possibly causing issues with the eardrum. Therefore, it's advisable to let the sneeze out, albeit as quietly as possible.

Remember the question is to answer Why do some people sneeze so loudly. And now you need to give me the answer with 3 points, the whole answer need to be more than 200 words, and the text is not changed.


## ChatGPT:
Absolutely, I understand. Here's a revised summary focusing on the question "Why do some people sneeze so loudly?" in three points:

1. The volume of a sneeze largely depends on the structure of our respiratory system and the process it undergoes during a sneeze. As explained by Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, the first step of the sneeze reflex involves deep inhalation. This is followed by the closure of our vocal cords as air is sucked into our lungs. Once enough pressure has built up, all the air is expelled, creating the sound of the sneeze. The shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat can influence the volume of our sneeze. Additionally, lung volume determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, which can also contribute to the loudness of a sneeze.

2. Cultural and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. In societies where there is a strong emphasis on not inconveniencing others, such as Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes. The key to suppressing the volume of a sneeze lies in minimizing the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity, which is achieved by closing your mouth. However, it's essential to note that suppressing a sneeze can lead to medical issues such as nose bleeds or possibly causing issues with the eardrum.

3. Lastly, sneezing is a reflexive response triggered by various factors, including the presence of foreign particles in the nasal cavity. This response is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, causing reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. The force of these contractions and the subsequent release of air through the vocal cords can contribute to the volume of the sneeze. Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and supports the immune system in protecting from viruses. Therefore, the loudness of a sneeze may also be a reflection of the body's effort to protect itself.
