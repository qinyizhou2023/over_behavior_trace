# Mechanism and Importance of Sneezing

## Message From You:
please help me summarize the mechanism of sneezing from this passage in brief. You may omit the Chinese definitions written in the passage 'Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.'

Sneezing is a vital mechanism for the body, serving as an air filter for the lungs, according to Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Our nose contains a dense network of multipurpose epithelial cells, small hairs, and thick mucus that work together to trap particles and protect the lungs. When these particles accumulate, they need to be expelled, which is done through sneezing. 

In addition, our nose houses immune cells that get activated when they sense high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, which are small compounds in our nasal cavity. As a response, the body produces more mucus, the nose begins to swell, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve. This sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, which then triggers reflexive muscle contractions, determining the speed of the sneeze. 

Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains that sneezing acts as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and assists the immune system in protecting from viruses. Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, so it's better to let it out. 

The most effective way to sneeze quietly is to keep the mouth closed. The sound of a sneeze isn't influenced by the cause of the sneeze, be it a virus or grass pollen. However, cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can influence the sound of a sneeze.

Sneezing, a protective mechanism, is triggered by a sneeze gene and small compounds in the nasal cavity. It helps the immune system by flushing out particles and old cells. The signal is processed by the hippocampus, causing reflexive muscle contractions. Mas Takashma and Sheena Cruikshank highlight its importance, noting that suppressing a sneeze can damage the nose and sinus. A quiet sneeze can be achieved by keeping the mouth closed. The sound of a sneeze isn't determined by its cause, but influenced by cultural, psychological, and societal factors.

please summarize this in 100 words 'Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.'


## Message From ChatGPT:
The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system. The process begins with deep inhalation, followed by the closure of vocal cords during which pressure builds up in the lungs. The sound of the sneeze is created by the air gushing through the vocal cords. The shape and flexibility of our vocal cords and throat tissue, along with lung volume, affect the sneeze's volume. However, sneeze volume isn't predictable by a single physical measure, as even individuals with large lung volumes can have quiet sneezes, according to Mas Takashma.
