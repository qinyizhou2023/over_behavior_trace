please conclude this passage into 3 main points: Why do some people sneeze so loudly? When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## ChatGPT:
1. The process and purpose of sneezing: Sneezing is a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity using a small compound. This process is initiated by immune cells in our nose that detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, resulting in reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed of the sneeze. This helps our immune system in protecting us from viruses.

2. Factors influencing the volume of sneezing: The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and the volume of our lungs. However, it's not just physical factors that play a role. Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze. For example, Dr. Takashma from the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, points out that people in Japan, where not inconveniencing others is heavily emphasized, manage to suppress their sneezes.

3. The potential dangers of suppressing sneezes and how to sneeze quietly: Holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus, as demonstrated by a case study of a man who fractured his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. However, if you need to sneeze quietly, Dr. Takashma suggests keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to do this. This can minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity, reducing the volume of your sneeze. Professor Sheena Cruikshank from the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology also affirms that the causes of sneezing vary, but the volume of a sneeze is not necessarily indicative of the cause.

here's a hint for you: the title is 'Why do some people sneeze so loudly?'. can you refine your answer?

## ChatGPT:
Absolutely, here's a refined version focusing on the main question:

1. The physiological factors behind loud sneezing: The volume of a sneeze is largely determined by the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and the volume of our lungs. A sneeze is caused by a small compound in our nasal cavity, and the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. Reflexive muscle contractions then determine the speed and volume of the sneeze.

2. Cultural and societal influences on sneeze volume: The volume of a person's sneeze isn't solely a physiological matter. Cultural factors, societal norms, and personal habits can also play a significant role. For example, people in Japan, where there is a cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, often suppress their sneezes. This was pointed out by Dr. Mas Takashma, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute.

3. The risks of suppressing sneezes and the solution for sneezing quietly: Suppressing a sneeze can potentially cause damage to the nose and sinus, and in extreme cases, it can even lead to fractures. However, if you need to sneeze quietly, keeping your mouth closed can minimize the volume of your sneeze, as suggested by Dr. Takashma. This reduces the resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity, thereby reducing the sneeze's volume.

The volume of a sneeze is determined by both physiological and societal factors. Physiologically, the structure of our respiratory system, including the shape of our vocal cords and lung volume, play a key role. The sneeze signal, triggered by a small compound in our nasal cavity, is processed by the hippocampus, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that dictate the sneeze's speed and volume.

Culturally, societal norms can influence sneeze volume. For instance, in societies like Japan where causing inconvenience to others is frowned upon, sneezes are often suppressed. This was noted by Dr. Mas Takashma of the Houston Methodist Academic Institute.

However, suppressing a sneeze can cause damage to the nose and sinus. To sneeze quietly without causing harm, Dr. Takashma recommends keeping the mouth closed, which reduces the resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, thereby lowering the sneeze's volume.
