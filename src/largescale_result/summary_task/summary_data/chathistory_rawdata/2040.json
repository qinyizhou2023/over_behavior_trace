# Understanding the Science of Sneezing

## Message From You:
Summarize this article in 200 words : When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

## Message From ChatGPT:
Sneezing is a vital bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism, helping to flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity. The sneeze reflex initiates with deep inhalation, and the volume of a sneeze is determined by factors such as the structure of our respiratory system and reflexive muscle contractions. The speed of a sneeze is determined by these contractions. 

Mas Takashma, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, explains that the gush of air passing through the vocal cords creates the sound of a sneeze. The volume and sound of a sneeze can also be influenced by cultural factors, societal norms and psychological factors. 

Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, explains that a sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain. Sneezing helps the immune system protect from viruses. However, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. The most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. 

Interestingly, a small compound in our nasal cavity is responsible for the sneeze gene. Despite the common belief, there's no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen.

Sneezing is a crucial body function that helps clear out our nasal cavity and aids our immune system in protecting from viruses. The sound and volume of a sneeze is influenced by our respiratory system, reflexive muscle contractions, and even cultural and societal norms. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. Mas Takashma and Sheena Cruikshank, medical professionals, stress that holding a sneeze back can harm the nose and sinus. The quietest way to sneeze is with a closed mouth. The sneeze gene is activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity. It's important to note that the loudness of a sneeze isn't determined by the type of irritant, like a virus or pollen.

how many words is this? : This article talks about how loud people sneeze and the importance of sneezing. Sneezing is an important function of our body that helps clear out our nasal cavity and helps our immune system by protecting and keeping out viruses from entering our body. The sounds and volume of our sneeze is influenced by a our respiratory system. Something i found interesting is that it can also be influenced by cultural norms. Like in Japan, in their culture, they value respecting others and to not inconvenience other, they are accustomed to sneeze as quietly as possible. The key to keeping quiet though, is simply to close your mouth, if you hold back a sneeze it can cause some medical issues like a nose bleed. All in all, the loudness of a sneeze ismt determined by the type of irritant like a virus or pollen, but rather by multiple factors ranging from cultural norms to the size of your lungs. People with larger lungs expell air at a constant and reasonable rate, so they often have petite sneezes.

Sure, here's an expanded ending:

All in all, the loudness of a sneeze isn't determined by the type of irritant like a virus or pollen, but rather by multiple factors ranging from cultural norms to the size of your lungs. People with larger lungs expel air at a constant and reasonable rate, so they often have petite sneezes. 

Moreover, the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain, and the sneeze gene, activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity, plays a significant role as well. Reflexive muscle contractions also determine the speed and intensity of the sneeze. It's fascinating to note that sneezing also serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells, contributing to the overall health of our respiratory system. 

Medical professionals, like Mas Takashma and Sheena Cruikshank, emphasize the potential harm of holding back a sneeze, as it may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. It's therefore recommended to sneeze naturally, albeit in a manner that's considerate of others. In conclusion, sneezing is a complex, multifaceted process influenced by both biological and sociocultural factors.
