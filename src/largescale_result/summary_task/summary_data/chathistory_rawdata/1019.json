# Why Sneezes Can Be Loud

## Message From You:
I am going to write a summary on why people sneeze so loudly?

## Message From ChatGPT:
Sure, I can help with that. Sneezing, a reflexive response, is caused by a small compound in our nasal cavity. This response is triggered by the presence of irritants and is controlled by a specific "sneeze gene". When an irritant is detected, a sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and volume of the sneeze.

Sneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and potentially harmful particles, assisting the immune system in protecting us from viruses. However, the volume of a sneeze is not just a biological factor. Cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms can also influence the sound of a sneeze.

Takashma, a renowned scientist, and Sheena Cruikshank, an expert in the field, both agree that holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. They recommend that the most effective way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. However, it's important to note that sneezing is a natural, healthy response and should not be suppressed unnecessarily.

## Message From You:
In the summary first 2 sentences should focus on importance of sneezing and nose (acting as a natural filter). 

## Message From ChatGPT:
Absolutely, I can revise the summary accordingly. 

Sneezing, a reflexive bodily function, plays a critical role in our health by acting as a protective mechanism. It helps to expel old cells and potentially harmful particles from our body, thereby aiding the immune system in protecting us from viruses. The nose, acting as a natural filter, traps these particles and when overwhelmed, triggers a sneeze through a small compound in our nasal cavity.

This sneeze response is controlled by a specific "sneeze gene". Once an irritant is detected, a sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in the brain, leading to reflexive muscle contractions that determine the speed and volume of the sneeze. The volume of a sneeze is influenced by not only these biological factors, but also by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms.
