# Understanding Loud Sneezes Causes Effects

## Message From You:
Please list the main points of this article: When I sneeze, everyone knows about it. The resulting shockwave(冲击波) wobbles windows, awakens sleeping animals, and sets nearby humans on edge. My partner, who sneezes like a vole(鼠狼) hiccupping(打嗝), insists I do this on purpose. I maintain that the urge to sneeze at this decibel(分贝) level is irresistible. Why do some people sneeze so loudly?

Let’s establish one thing first: Sneezing is important for the body. “The nose is an air filter for the lungs,” says Mas Takashima, the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. Inside our nose is a tight mesh of epithelial cells(上皮细胞) (a multipurpose cell found all over the body), tiny hairs, and thick mucus. These elements, says Takashima, “trap particulates(颗粒物) so that the lungs can be protected.” When those particulates build up, they need to be flushed out.

There are also populations of immune cells in our nose, which wake up when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. “Some of the chemicals that are made as a consequence of that immune response cause changes in the lining of our nose,” says Sheena Cruickshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology. Those changes will be familiar to anyone who has endured a pollen-laden summer or phlegmy winter. The body makes more mucus, swelling starts in the nose, and signals are sent to the brain via the trigeminal nerve(三叉神经,面部感觉的主要神经), which provides sensation to the face. This signal is processed by an area at the base of our brain called the medulla oblongata(延髓,大脑的一部分，控制许多自主功能，如心跳和呼吸), resulting in reflexive muscle contractions(反射性肌肉收缩). This all leads to a sneeze. But while the causes of sneezing vary, there’s no reason a virus should produce a louder sneeze than grass pollen, says Cruickshank.

Instead, the key to sneezing volume lies in the structure of our respiratory system. The first step of the sneeze reflex, says Takashima, involves deep inhalation. “

You need that air to be able to expel everything out,” he adds. While air is sucked into our lungs, our vocal cords close tightly. Once enough pressure has built up in our lungs, all the air is expelled. “It is that gush of air that’s pushing through the vocal cords that creates the sound of the sneeze,” says Takashima. The shape and “floppiness(松软度)” of our vocal cords and other soft tissue at the back of the throat influence whether or not we have a quiet or booming sneeze. Lung volume also determines how much air enters and leaves our chest during a sneeze, meaning no single physical measurement will predict sneeze volume. “Some people with big lung volumes have very petite sneezes,” says Takashima.

Can I blame my resonant(共鸣的) throat the next time I rip space-time with a sneeze? Unfortunately, Takashima says it isn’t that simple. “There’s societal norms or cultural factors that can influence the sound of a sneeze,” he says.

Takashima points out that in Japan, where there is a heavy cultural emphasis on not inconveniencing others, people manage to suppress their sneezes. The key here, he says, is to minimize the amount of resonant energy flowing through your oral cavity(口腔)–in simple terms, closing your mouth. This, he says, will reduce the volume of your sneeze.

Is the solution to this deafening problem really that simple? A look at the medical literature suggests that sneeze suppression may be a surprisingly bad idea. A case study from a hospital in the Belgian city of Liège is a cautionary tale. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic–when loud sneezing did not go down well in public–a 38-year-old man reported pain and swelling in his face after holding back a sneeze. A scan revealed he had fractured(骨折的) his sinus(鼻窦). Takashima backs this up. “By suppressing a sneeze, you can cause some medical issues such as nose bleeds,” he says. “You can force air up the Eustachian tube(咽鼓管,连接中耳和鼻咽部的管道), possibly causing issues with your eardrum(鼓膜).”

But the next time you find a dust mote(微粒) tickling your throat in a library, or while a pet sleeps comfortably nearby, there is an alternative to a loud sneeze. “There are times where you don’t want to make a scene or you want to try to keep it as quiet as possible,” says Takashima. “Keeping your mouth closed as you sneeze can definitely do that.”

Sneezing is an important bodily function that serves as a protective mechanism to flush out old cells and particulates from our nasal cavity, which also helps our immune system in protecting us from viruses. This process is initiated by the presence of a small compound in our nasal cavity and the sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. The chair of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Houston Methodist Academic Institute, Mas Takashma, explains that the nose acts as an air filter for the lungs, trapping particulates to protect the lungs. 

When these particulates build up, they need to be expelled, and this is where sneezing comes in. Sheena Cruikshank, a professor in the University of Manchester’s Division of Immunology, adds that immune cells in our nose become active when they detect high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds. This causes changes in the lining of our nose, leading to more mucus production, swelling, and signals being sent to the brain. 

The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and reflexive muscle contractions. The process involves deep inhalation, closure of vocal cords, and a build-up of pressure in the lungs. The sound of a sneeze is created when the air gushes out through the vocal cords. The shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissues at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume, influence the volume of our sneeze. 

However, societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can also influence the sound of a sneeze. In cultures where there is an emphasis on not inconveniencing others, such as Japan, people tend to suppress their sneezes. This is achieved by reducing the amount of resonant energy flowing through the oral cavity, essentially by keeping the mouth closed. 

However, holding back a sneeze may cause damage to the surface of the nose and sinus. A case study from a hospital in Belgium reported a man fracturing his sinus after suppressing a sneeze. But in situations where a loud sneeze may be inappropriate, keeping the mouth closed can help to reduce the volume of the sneeze.

## Message From ChatGPT:
The article initially underscores sneezing as an integral bodily function, serving two primary purposes. It facilitates the expulsion of old cells and particulates from the nasal cavity, a process initiated by a specific compound found therein. Furthermore, sneezing aids in safeguarding our immune system against viral infections.

The mechanics of sneezing are then elucidated. The brain's hippocampus processes the sneeze signal, while the nose, functioning as an air filter for the lungs, traps particulates. The immune cells in the nose spring into action upon detecting high levels of sneeze-inducing compounds, causing alterations in the nasal lining.

The article proceeds to explore the origins of the sneeze sound. The volume of a sneeze is determined by the structure of our respiratory system and reflexive muscle contractions. The sneezing process involves deep inhalation, closure of vocal cords, and a build-up of pressure in the lungs. The sound of a sneeze is produced when air is forcefully expelled through the vocal cords. The volume of a sneeze can be influenced by factors such as the shape and "floppiness" of our vocal cords and other soft tissues at the back of the throat, as well as lung volume.

Lastly, the article delves into how societal norms, cultural factors, and psychological factors can influence the sound of a sneeze. In cultures where there is an emphasis on not inconveniencing others, individuals often suppress their sneezes by keeping their mouths closed. However, this could potentially damage the surface of the nose and sinuses. In circumstances where a loud sneeze may be deemed inappropriate, keeping the mouth closed can effectively reduce the volume of the sneeze.
