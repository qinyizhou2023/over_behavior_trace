## ChatGPT:
Absolutely, here are some tips that might be helpful for your visit:

1. **Amarienborg**: Remember to reserve your ticket in advance due to its popularity. Also, try to get there by 12:00 to witness the change of guard.

2. **Frederiks Kirke**: This is a modern architecture, so take your time to appreciate the details and design.

3. **The Little Mermaid Statue**: It's located by the water, so it could be a bit chilly. Dress warmly!

4. **Noma**: It's a high-end restaurant, so make sure to dress appropriately. Also, it's recommended to make a reservation in advance.

5. **Rundetaarn**: The tower provides a great view of the city, so don't forget your camera!

Tips:
1. The type of power sockets used in Denmark are Type A and Type K.
2. The official currency in Denmark is the Danish Krone (DKK). Most places do not accept euros.
3. There are in total 6 metros in Copenhagen. Visitors can reach anywhere by metro. This will be especially handy when getting to Amarienborg within 10 minutes from the airport.
4. The weather in Copenhagen in December is below -15 degrees Celsius. So, pack your warmest clothes if you're visiting in December.
5. The official language is Danish, but English is widely spoken in Copenhagen. So, you should have no trouble communicating.
6. The “hello” in Danish is “hej”, “thank you” in Danish is “farvel”, “goodbye” in Danish is “tak”.
7. Copenhagen follows left-hand drive. So, be mindful when crossing the streets.
8. You can get a Copenhagen Card that covers 80 attractions and public transports with $30. This could save you a lot of money if you plan to visit many attractions.
9. The tip rate in Copenhagen is over 50%. So, be ready to tip generously, especially at Noma.

Enjoy your trip!
