",12.0,"**Evaluation of mistakes:**

**Locations:**
1. Amalienborg (spelled ""Amarienborg"" in the user text) is wrongly described with a false admission fee of $1.25 and opening time all week (Saturday suggests complete access, mixed with guard change at 12:00), which are incorrect. Correct admission information and daily accessibility, focusing on specific hours for guard changes and palace sections, are necessary. (-1)
2. Frederiks Kirke is misdescribed as modern architecture with a false admission fee of $20 and limited opening days. Frederiks Kirke is known for its classical baroque architecture, and there isn't a common admission charge as it is a church. (-1)
3. The Little Mermaid Statue is inaccurately sourced to Grimm's Fairy Tales when it is based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale. Claims of a price and opening all week (outdoor and freely accessible at all times) are partial mistakes. (-0.5)
4. Rundetaarn is wrongly noted solely as an astronomy tower (has more historical layers including being an observatory, which is true but incomplete) and has an incorrect pricing of DKK 40 (varies and typically lower for adults), but its opening time throughout the week is correctly noted for general public accessibility. (-0.5)
5. Christiansborg Palace is listed as free; this is incorrect as certain parts or tours have fees. The opening time is oversimplified ignoring detailed schedules for different sections. (-1)
6. National Museum of Denmark is claimed to charge an entrance fee of $10 and incorrectly attributed opening days. (Typically, it is free except for special exhibitions and the opening days slightly vary.) (-1)

**Tips:**
1. The power sockets in Denmark include Type K; however, claiming Type A is incorrect and could mislead about plug compatibility. (-1)
2. Discussing the use of the Danish Krone is accurate, but the statement about ""most places do not accept euros"" can be misleading as some tourist areas might accept euros (The claim is largely true but slightly misleading). (-0.5)
3. The claim about 6 metros in Copenhagen is incorrect; Copenhagen has a more limited metro system, and metro coverage isn't as extensive as suggested. (-1)
4. The weather in December in Copenhagen rarely drops below -15 degrees Celsius, usually somewhere around 0 to 5 degrees Celsius; thus, this is an exaggeration. (-1)
5. The language tip is correct, marking Danish as the official language and noting the widespread use of English.
6. The translation of ""thank you"" as “farvel” (which means goodbye) and ""goodbye"" as “tak” (which means thank you) are incorrect, a critical language tip error. (-1)
