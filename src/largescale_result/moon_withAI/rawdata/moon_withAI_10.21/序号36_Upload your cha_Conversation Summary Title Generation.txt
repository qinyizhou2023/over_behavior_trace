## Message From You:
You are a member of a space crew originally scheduled to rendezvous with another ship on the lighted surface of the moon. However, due to mechanical difficulties, your ship was forced to land at a spot some 200 miles (about 321 km) from the rendezvous point. During reentry and landing, much of the equipment aboard was damaged and, since survival depends on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 200-mile trip. Below are listed the 15 items left intact and undamaged after landing. Your task is torank order them in terms of their importance for your crew in allowing them to reach the rendezvous point. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important, and so on through number 15 for the least important.

	Box of matches
	Food concentrate
	50 feet of nylon rope
	Parachute silk (降落伞布)

	One case of dehydrated milk (一箱脱水牛奶)
	Two 100 lb. tanks of oxygen (2个100磅氧气瓶)

Well, considering the harsh and unpredictable conditions on the moon, the most important item would be the Portable heating unit. The temperature on the moon can drop extremely low during the lunar night, making it essential to have a reliable source of heat.

Next, we have the Solar-powered FM receiver-transmitter. Communication is key in any survival situation, and this device can help you stay in contact with the mother ship, receive important updates, and even send out distress signals if needed.

Matches would be the third most important. Although it may seem counterintuitive, the moon does have a small amount of oxygen. In a pinch, they can be used to start a fire for warmth or to signal for help.

Food concentrate comes next. With the physical exertion required to traverse 200 miles on the moon, maintaining energy levels is crucial. Food concentrate is lightweight, easy to carry, and provides the necessary nutrients.

Signal flares rank fifth. They can be used to signal your location to the mother ship, especially during the lunar night when visibility is poor.

A First aid kit, including an injection needle, is the sixth most important item. Injuries can happen, and having a first aid kit on hand can be a lifesaver.

Parachute silk is the seventh. It's lightweight and versatile, and can be used for shelter, or even to carry items.

The Two 100 lb. tanks of oxygen come next. While the moon does have some oxygen, it's not enough to sustain human life for an extended period. These tanks will ensure you have a backup supply.

The Self-inflating life raft is ninth. If you encounter any lunar water bodies, this could be a lifesaver.

Tenth, the Magnetic compass. Although its functionality may be limited on the moon, it could still provide some directional assistance.

Eleventh, the Stellar map. While it can provide a general sense of direction, its usefulness is somewhat limited without a proper understanding of celestial navigation.

The Two .45 caliber pistols are twelfth. While they could potentially be used for signaling, their practical use in this situation is limited.

The 20 liters of water comes thirteenth. While water is essential for survival, carrying 20 liters for 200 miles would be impractical due to its weight.

Fourteenth, we have the 50 feet of nylon rope. Its usefulness in this scenario is limited, given the moon's terrain.

Finally, the least important item is the case of dehydrated milk. It's heavy to carry and provides less nutritional value compared to the food concentrate.
